	{"title":"Human Organ Trafficking", "text": "Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Organs Watch: Below is a paper by Nancy Scheper-Hughes, ​the Chancellor’s Professor of Medical Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. Scheper-Hughes co-founded Organs Watch in 1999 and her investigative research into an international ring of organ traffickers led to arrests several years later. Organs Watch has identified at least 50 nations that have been involved in organ transplantation for profit. Nancy and Organs Watch have played a large role in spreading awareness of organ trafficking in organized crime. Corrupt government officials are bought off and very few people involved in organ trafficking networks are prosecuted - the ones who have are slapped with fines or ridiculously short prison sentences. For decades this has been covered up, as health professionals along with government officials worldwide denied that organ trafficking even existed. Many still believe that it’s an extremely rare occurrence. The poor are the ones that are taken advantage of; coerced, lied to, kidnapped and murdered. The poor are used to make a profit and keep the wealthy alive longer. The wealthy are the ones that run the corporations, the governments, and they are even the ones that fund the so called “humanitarian” non-profits. It’s not that hard to figure out how something so horrific and widespread can be kept quiet for so long. Too many believe that a “conspiracy” or “crime” involving a large number of people could not possibly exist, because there’s no way it could be kept silent and allowed to continue. If you believe this, please do some research into the history of organized crime or the CIA. It’s very possible. We’ve been spoon-fed propaganda our whole lives and sadly the majority still believe exactly what those in power want them to believe. Slowly more people are waking up to the atrocities committed by the global plutocracy, and the more people wake up, the harder the corrupt will push back – which is what we’re witnessing now. The repressive laws that have been introduced and passed in the last several years are an indication of this. These laws are becoming more repressive and are being introduced with more frequency. USIA Propaganda Agents: We’ve also posted a report released in 1994, titled The Child Organ Trafficking Rumor: A Modern ‘Urban Legend’. The report was created by Todd Leventhal of the United States Information Agency (USIA) and submitted to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography. You’ll also find links to multiple reports and news articles on organ trafficking in the reference section below. The history of the USIA is subject worth covering in its own report, but in general, the USIA was a US propaganda agency along the same vein as Voice of America (VOA) and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). I’ve found the easiest way to understand government agencies and their doublespeak is to replace the word “information” with “disinformation”, and replace the word “diplomacy” with “forced or coerced cooperation”. Then it becomes rather clear what these agencies are truly created for. In Leventhal’s report he not only makes the case that rumors of children being kidnapped and trafficked for organ harvesting is a myth, but that organ trafficking itself didn’t exist. Every account was false because such a thing wouldn’t even be possible. After reading enough BS from these disinfo agents it has become pretty easy to spot them - from the language they use and the types of claims that they make. Normally these guys aren’t subtle, rather they are in-your-face pretentious assholes and they all go through the same information operations training. After enough research they all sound the same and are extremely obvious. But they happen to be the older generation of disinfo agents left over from the Cold War. The new generation is much more subtle and sneaky. There has since been a lot of evidence to support the fact that organ trafficking does exist, and it is a part of international organized crime networks. Arrests have been made, but prosecution is extremely difficult. The emphasis that Leventhal places on debunking every possible rumor of organ trafficking in the media, as well as repeatedly stating how impossible it would be for such a thing to even occur, makes me believe it wasn’t just ignorance or naivety behind these assertions. His report sounds more like the US State Department actively trying to cover up the existence of organ trafficking. In his position within the US State Department, he would be aware that organ trafficking was real… and to write a report made to convince people it was all a myth, a silly fear and the imagination gone wild – well, that is truly one of the most evil disinformation campaigns I’ve seen so far. A Modern ‘Urban Legend’: Here are some excerpts from Leventhal’s report, where he emphasizes the fact that organ trafficking does not exist and could never be possible. ​“Organ transplant experts agree that it would be impossible to successfully conceal any clandestine murder-for-organ-trafficking ring. Because of the large number of people who must be involved in an organ transplant, the sophisticated medical technology needed to conduct such operations, the extremely short amount of time that organs remain viable for transplant, and the abhorrent nature of the alleged activities, such operations could neither be organized clandestinely nor be kept secret.” ​He refutes every single account or rumor of organ trafficking, saying there is no evidence or information that can back the claims. He goes through each account individually explaining how it was either a lie, a hoax, and\/or hysteria, without providing any evidence of his own claims. For example: “A September 1993 European Parliament resolution also gave credence to allegations of child organ trafficking. It was unfortunately based on an August 1992 article in “Le Monde Diplomatique” that was full of inaccuracies, including many claims that had been disproved or repudiated years earlier.” ​ ​ ​That’s his entire statement debunking this particular claim. Inaccuracies? Disproved claims? Repudiated years earlier? Where are his references for this information? How do we know he didn’t just make all of that up? Considering who he worked for I wouldn’t be surprised if he did. I’m not implying that false rumors of child kidnappings, murder and conspiracies of organ trafficking don’t exist, or that all of the claims listed in his report are true. But Leventhal did not provide any evidence of his assertions that these accounts were false – only stating things such as, “it was later proven false”. He’s insisting there’s no evidence of these claims, and at the same time not providing any evidence of his own claims that they are false. USIA’s Propaganda 101, Lesson One: Be a hypocrite and provide no evidence of your claims. “Despite the impossibility of such practices occurring, and the fact that no credible evidence has ever been produced to substantiate rumors of such activities…” “Given the total lack of evidence for the child organ trafficking myth, its impossibility from a technical point of view, and the widespread, serious damage that it has already caused and is likely to cause in the future, the United States Information Agency respectfully requests that the U.N. Special Rapporteur give maximum attention and publicity to the information in this report, which demonstrates the groundlessness of reports of child organ trafficking and the impossibility of such practices occurring. Otherwise, more innocent people may become victims of this deadly rumor.” ​Yes, Todd, because the victims of the rumor are the ones we should be worried about. Not the victims of actual organ trafficking. “In the real world, as opposed to the world of fiction, as organ transplantation procedures have advanced in various countries, they have been accompanied by the development of elaborate ethical guidelines, designed to guard against possible abuses, to ensure fairness in allocating organs, to prohibit the sale of organs, and to protect the rights and sensitivities of those involved in the transplant process. As the practice of organ transplantation spreads to more countries, guidelines governing it have been adopted more widely. Laws forbidding the sale of organs for transplant now exist in approximately 50 countries and non- statutory measures aimed at accomplishing the same purpose are present in nine countries. But not even the most elaborate, carefully constructed safeguards can quiet all anxieties. Many people remain anxious about imagined dangers from organ transplantation.” ​ ​​There are laws against murder too, Todd, but that still happens in the real world. “There was no evidence that such gruesome trade exists.” “Claims of a compensatory cash payment also conveniently provide a supposed reason why no one has ever come forward with evidence of such an alleged crime.” ​Yes, it’s ridiculous to think bribery happens in this civilized world. “On September 14, 1993, the European Parliament adopted a “Resolution on Prohibiting Trade in Transplant Organs.” Two of its preambular clauses stated: whereas there is evidence that foetuses, children and adults in some developing countries have been mutilated and others murdered with the aim of obtaining transplant organs for export to rich countries, (and) …having regard to the current existence of trafficking in foetuses, children and incapable adults who are used as organ providers, the resolution then stated that it: calls for action to be taken to put a stop to the mutilation and murder of foetuses, children and adults in certain developing countries for the purpose of providing transplant organs. “The resolution was based on a February 25, 1993 “Report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on prohibiting trade in transplant organs.” The rapporteur for the report was Mr. Leon Schwartzenberg, a Europarliamentarian who had formerly served as Minister of Health in France. Following a sensitive, nuanced, and informative discussion of the medical, ethical, and social factors involved in the transplant organ shortage, the report unfortunately went on to give credence to the organ trafficking rumors, stating: Organized trafficking in organs exists in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs, and is often controlled by the same people. This traffic is all the more monstrous where it involved killing people to remove organs which can be sold at a profit. To deny the existence of such trafficking is comparable to denying the existence of the ovens and gas chambers during the last war.” ​Preposterous! Isn’t it Todd? –Oh wait… it has been proven that “organized trafficking in organs exists” and it is “often controlled by the same people” that traffick in illegal drugs. “Doctor Arturo Dib Kuri, director of the Health Secretariat’s National Transplants Register, expresses this opinion: “The possibilities of human organ and tissue trafficking are extremely remote. It would be virtually impossible to conceal a criminal organization of this magnitude.” ​And yet, it was concealed for decades, with the help of disinformation agents like Todd Leventhal. “Dib Kuri comments: The number of persons engaged in a surgical practice of this type, and the complex hospital infrastructure that it requires, make it extremely difficult to keep this type of crime clandestine, in the event that anyone were to attempt to deal in organs. I can’t imagine one of those 10 doctors that we have in Mexico who are capable of making a transplant becoming involved with a criminal organization engaged in such activities. These are not operations that can be performed in any old hospital. The recipient would not risk receiving an organ from anyone. All this is a mere rumor. I don’t dare deny that there are stolen children, but it could be done for other purposes, such as prostitution; it is highly unlikely to be for the purpose of extracting and selling their organs.” “President Callejas and others concluded that such clandestine organ trafficking was impossible in Honduras for technical reasons and that there was no reason to believe that any such activities had ever occurred.” ​Ever? Really? “On page 184, the book quotes the International Association of Democratic Lawyers: It is becoming increasingly difficult to procure reliable information on the organ traffic, especially when it affects children, owing to that traffic’s link with criminal organizations. Official investigations are being conducted in nearly all the Latin American countries, but no judicial proceedings are being initiated, because the witnesses and evidence disappear quickly. … The victims of this abominable traffic are kidnapped. Those later found still alive are usually under the effects of strong drugs that prevent them from remembering what has happened. Generally, their names are unknown, because the victims and their families fear the revenge of the traffickers.” “This assertion by the IADL is a masterpiece of obfuscation. It cites no specifics for its sweeping claims, conveniently claiming that the lack of any evidence for child organ trafficking is due to supposed fear of reprisals and alleged drugging of the presumed victims.” ​Fear of reprisal from criminal organizations? In Latin America? This is a ridiculous excuse for lack of evidence and witnesses. Who would believe such a wild claim, Todd? Nameless bodies pile up in drug cartel violence: “(…)police found 49 dismembered bodies strewn on a Mexican highway leading to the Texas border. The 49 bodies now appear headed for an increasingly common fate in this drug war-wracked country: They could join the growing ranks of the unidentified dead. That group has become legion as nearly 16,000 bodies remain unidentified, says the National Human Rights Commission, an independent government agency. In total, 24,000 people have been reported missing. Many say the country’s police are simply overwhelmed by the number of drug war casualties as they struggle with poor forensic capabilities and the reluctance of some witnesses and victims’ relatives to help.” ​Original Link: ps:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/world\/nameless-bodies-pile-drug-cartel-violence-article-1.1120726 Archive: https:\/\/archive.fo\/fGAoq Mexican drugs gang dumps 35 bodies on city highway in rush hour as they point guns at terrified drivers: “Suspected drug traffickers drove two trucks to a main avenue in a Mexican Gulf coast city and dumped 35 dead bodies during rush hour while gunmen stood guard and pointed their weapons at frightened motorists.” Original Link: http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-2039937\/Mexican-drug-lords-dump-35-dead-bodies-road-wave-guns-passing-drivers.html Archive: https:\/\/archive.fo\/b5C1g Body of slain Mexican journalist found wrapped in plastic, handcuffed on side of highway: “The body of a Mexican journalist who was kidnapped from her home by a group of armed men Monday was found handcuffed and bound, with a plastic bag wrapped around her head and dumped on the side of a highway Tuesday, according to Mexican media reports.” Original Link: http:\/\/www.mysanantonio.com\/news\/us-world\/border-mexico\/article\/Body-of-slain-Mexican-journalist-found-wrapped-in-6820748.php Archive: https:\/\/archive.fo\/i5w1L Mexico police suspected over deaths of 28 people found mutilated in secret grave – close to where students disappeared last week: “Twenty-eight bodies have been found in unmarked graves outside a city in Mexico where police clashed with student protesters a week ago, but the remains are too damaged for immediate identification.

Police officers who took away the students after the confrontation in Iguala allegedly handed the young men over to the Guerreros Unidos cartel. Gang members apparently thought the students were members of a rival gang or believed they had been sent to disrupt a public event held by the wife of the Iguala mayor, who is alleged to have ties with the gang.

Nor would it be possible to arrange such a procedure for purely logistical reasons alone because the technical resources required could not be assembled outside of major medical centers.” ”(…)It is important to remember that transplant surgeons and physicians are highly trained professionals who are handsomely compensated for their expertise. There would be no reason for them to engage in clandestine, illegal transplantations. On the contrary, they would have every incentive not to participate in such activities.” Personally, Todd, I think there’s no “reason” someone would cover up the abuses and crimes of the plutocracy, endangering the lives of more innocent people, and by doing so be complicit in their crimes… unless they were actually complicit in those crimes. But alas, here we are. Archived from the International Affairs Forum: ​​Organ Trafficking in Times of War and Political Conflict. (Nancy Scheper-Hughes). Chancellor’s Professor, Chair of the Doctoral Program in Medical Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley. 2016 Today, following decades of denial, human trafficking for the removal of kidneys from the living is recognized and condemned by the global medical and transplant professions. (Ambagtsheer, F., and W. Weimar W. 2012 and 2016 ). The United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UN 2000a) and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons (UN 2000b) recognizes forced labor, sex, and human trafficking in kidneys as organized crime, a human rights abuse, and as a potential crime against humanity. The Istanbul Declaration of 2008 (Danovitch, et al, 2013; Capron and Delmonico, 2015) convened by transplant professionals from the Transplantation Society (TTS) and the International Society of Nephrology established a set of universal first principles and an international custodial group to oversee transplant laws, practices, and violations regarding human organs trafficking. Despite these prohibitions and the criminalization of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal, the global quest for fresh organs is widespread, involving private, clandestine, and public exchanges among buyers, brokers, surgeons, and sellers from North and South, East and West (Scheper-Hughes 2003a and b; 2008, 20011a and b, 2014). It is, as I have argued elsewhere, a protected crime (Scheper-Hughes 2013). Here, I will address another and more hidden dimension of organ trafficking: the plunder of the bodies of the enemy during or in the aftermath of wars, with the complicity and collaboration of militarized police states. The theft and plunder of enemy bodies, living and dead, during times of war, has a long genealogy (Harrison, 2013). Medicalized executions for organ procurement for transplantation and for commercial uses during political conflict, civil wars, and ethnic cleansings represent a worst-case scenario and a collective human nightmare: the fear of being cannibalized while living or dead. In each of the cases documented by Organs Watch bearing on disappeared bodies, illegal dissections, and the harvesting and stockpiling of organs, tissues, and other body parts (limbs, torsos, and heads) from the bodies of the enemy, fact and fiction, truth and rumor, the hallucinatory and cold, forensic medical facts are often combined. The motives behind the plunder of enemy bodies - for example, the violations of Palestinian enemy bodies at the National Forensic Institute of Abu Kabir in Tel Aviv and the abuses of the mentally and cognitively challenged inmates of Argentina’s National asylum as free sources of blood from the living and cornea, and heart valves and organs from the dead during and after the Argentine Dirty War - were political and military ideologies and the greed of financial corruption. In Argentina, a Nazi-like scheme to plunder the bodies of psychiatric inmates - seen as an eyesore to the fascist state - managed to supply Argentina with all the cornea and blood it needed. Blood was extracted from patients at Colonia Montes de Oca and sold to private hospitals. During the Falkland War, the blood was supplied to the military for injured soldiers and for military officials and family members who needed blood infusions. (Scheper-Hughes, 2015). Similarly, during the anti-Apartheid struggle in Cape Town, South Africa, police mortuaries piled up with the bodies of young black men killed by police, and those bodies were used as sources of tissues and other biomaterials for White South Africans. This case was similar to the allegations of organ theft by KLA militants from Serbs remaining in Kosovo and Albania at the end of the Kosovo War in 1999 (Ghia, 2011). These cases were born of contradictory motives, ranging from race hatred, retaliation, nationalist interests, the desire to display power and authority, and ordinary greed and corruption.​ ​In times of instability, severe rights abuses are conducted through the theft of illicit organs and tissues from prisoners of war, mental patients, and the unwanted dead bodies of the poor. Organs and tissues are harvested from socially and politically dead nonpersons, the Homo Sacer of the postmodern era. These acts are so abhorrent that they fall under the moral-political category of crimes against humanity: evil crimes. Mobilities and Immobilities. Trafficking Syrian Refugees in Detention Camps: Until fairly recently, anthropologists liked to describe the new globalized world as one in which extreme mobility, flexibility, and the free circulation of people, technologies, and capital are all regulated by world banks and world courts and aided by Doctors Without Borders. Today, however, we face a very different world, resulting from the chaos of unresolved - or unresolvable - warfare in the Middle East and its producing the tragedy of political asylum seekers in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, alongside a rising tide of neo-Nazism in countries and places that we can hardly fathom: Denmark, of all places, Hungary, and Poland. The United States has its own “great migration,” as refugees from Honduras, one of the world’s most violent and dangerous countries, and those escaping the drug wars and vigilantes who control large swaths of Mexico, are being hunted for their kidneys. Since the beginning of the war in Syria, religious and cultural minorities in ISIS-controlled areas have made the trek now known as the “Great Migration” across the borders of Syria to Turkey, Lebanon, Italy, and Scandinavia by foot, bicycle, taxi, and, most notoriously, by dinghy, rafts, and “boats of wrath.” It is the bodies of the meticulously dressed toddlers washed up on the sandy shores that move the world’s indifferent citizens. Stateless people are nobody’s primary concern, not even in nations we came to think of as cosmopolitan secular humanist states, including Denmark, Hungary, Italy, and Germany. Xenophobia is raising its ugly head in Europe and the United States. Man is Wolf to Man: An Organ Trafficker Among the Sheep: In December 2015, a man named Boris Wolfman (or Volfman) was arrested in Istanbul, where he had been contacting Syrian refugees to recruit them to sell their organs to foreign transplant tourists who would be treated in one of the several private transplant units in Turkish hospitals. Wolfman was a fugitive wanted in Israel, where he had been indicted for setting up illegal transplant operations in shadowy clinics in Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka, and other locations for international transplant patients willing to pay upwards of $100,000 for an illegal transplant with a kidney from an anonymous trafficked person. Wolfman was known among both kidney sellers and transplant tourists alike as ruthless. He was part of an international organized crime network that spanned the globe. In the beginning, it was fairly easy to recruit new immigrants to Israel, mostly refugees from economically devastated countries like Moldova, the Ukraine, and Romania, who were eager to settle in Israel but who needed help. Brokers, like Wolfman, met immigrants on arrival and promised them help in getting residency and even citizenship in Israel if they were willing to serve the country by selling a kidney in a foreign clinic for several thousand dollars. With the passage of new laws in Israel making kidney brokering a crime, Wolfman saw another option: the great migration of political refugees from Syria. They would be easy targets: dazed, disoriented, and willing to do anything to ​get their children to safe ground. Parting with a kidney might be the least of what they had had to suffer in getting to the West or at least as far as Adana or Istanbul in Turkey. Poor and ethnic minority Syrians had long been exposed to kidney trafficking inside Syria. Before the wars that have wrecked the country, kidney selling among the poor was a last resort—an ugly but familiar one. Today, Syrian refugees are being trafficked and welcomed in detention centers by kidney smugglers. A 19-year-old Syrian refugee named Raïd fled with his family of six siblings from Aleppo to Beirut, Lebanon. There, he was contacted by a kidney hunter, Abu Hussain. Like Boris Wolfman, Hussain had sent out kidney runners to locate freshly arrived refugees and offer them money and help with immigration authorities if they agreed to sell a kidney. A kidney for a temporary visa, what could be better than that? Lebanon, like Turkey, has long been a facilitation site for illegal transplants, one serving thousands of transplant tourists, with many coming from the Persian Gulf. Before Syrians began filling this niche, Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon provided the kidneys desired by transplant patients. Today, Syrian refugees are new bait, cheaper and more desperate. Raïd told Der Spiegel that he sold his kidney to help his family survive in the detention center, but he was defrauded of the promised money and deposited on the curb after his painful surgery, without even pain medication or antibiotics. “Shut up. I don’t care if you die. You’re finished anyway,” his broker told him (Putz, 2013). At the beginning of the latest political conflict in Syria, I was contacted by a political refugee in the Bay Area of California to obtain political asylum following a kidney removal at the famous Cleveland Clinic Transplant unit. Salah X. was a bonded servant to a royal family in Qatar, who, in the last year of his bonded servitude, was taken to the United States without his knowledge of what he would be doing there for the family. Upon arrival, he was told that he would be providing a kidney to a member of the royal family related to his boss. The Cleveland clinic paid no attention to Salah’s panic and his attempt to leave the hospital surgical ward. The kidney removal proceeded without the man’s consent. He refused to return to Qatar and, with the help of a lawyer, filed a petition for political asylum based on his fears of retribution from his employer and his status in Syria as a political minority, a Druze cleric. I wrote a deposition based on copies of Salah’s medical records. He was, however, denied political asylum, and he disappeared from the radar. As for Boris Wolfman, I am told from inside sources that he is in custody in Israel. Syrians continue to be targets of other brokers from other countries, even in the United States. Boris’s unfortunate surname evokes the ancient Roman Latin proverb, Homo homini lupus: “A man is a wolf to man.” ISIS and Allegations of Organ Trafficking: In March 2015, I was bombarded by telephone calls from CNN and other international news services to comment on allegations by the Iraqi ambassador to the UN, Mohamed Alhakim, who, at a special meeting with the UN Security Counsel, called on the Counsel to investigate the deaths of 12 doctors in Mosul, Iraq. He said they were killed after refusing to remove organs from the bodies of captives held by ISIS. “Some of the bodies we found are mutilated… and (body) parts are missing” (Sanchez 2015). According to the UN ambassador, bodies were exhumed from shallow graves in an undisclosed location in Iraq and were missing kidneys and other organs. “We have bodies,” he said. “Come and examine them.” These allegations followed earlier international reports that ISIS had opened a medical school in its main stronghold in Syria and that doctors there had been forced to remove organs from prisoners of war, including Iraqis across religious and ethnic divides: Sunni, Shia, Christian, and Turkman. There were also reports of ​medicalized executions by ISIS during which transplant organs were taken. This would be similar to the medicalized executions of prisoners (many of them allegedly political prisoners) in China who were and continue to be harvested. Reports that ISIS was using organs as an additional source of income and simultaneously as a display of power (like beheadings) were also being considered. When asked by CNN to comment on these reports, I took a deep breath, thinking that this was perhaps one battle in which I did not wish to be involved. Nonetheless, I commented that the demand for organs and tissues was insatiable (Sanchez 2015). Similar cases include the allegations by the Council of Europe (Marty, 2010) of kidnapping, murder, and medicalized executions with kidney removal of political prisoners—Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo—in secret detention camps in Kosovo and Albania at the end of the Kosovo War. During initial United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) investigations, witnesses testified that kidneys were removed during executions and flown to Turkey. Some witnesses were murdered, forensic data were lost or destroyed, and the investigations were interrupted. In September 2011, the Chief Prosecutor, Clint Williamson of the Special Investigative Task Force (SITF), concluded that a small number of these cases could be substantiated. Today, EU prosecutor David Schweindeman is leading a bicameral tribunal with the government of Kosovo on war crimes committed by the KLA, including harvesting organs from prisoners of war (Vukusic, 2016). Dangerous Rumors: Trafficking for organs is not uncommon in war zones, areas dealing with political conflict, transitional states, and regions suffering from natural disasters, like the earthquakes in Turkey and Haiti. These conditions create public chaos, which provides a cover for illegal harvesting and plundering of the bodies of the dead. However, at the same time, these conditions can stir up rumors of organ harvesting, without any forensic evidence. Of course, some of these allegations are false, based on moral panic, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the anxieties and worst fears of vulnerable populations and ethnic groups. For many marginalized populations across the world who have experienced the disappearances of their loved ones, and to whom almost anything could be done, even the theft of organs, the fears are based on a real sense of existential insecurity. There were, for example, allegations of illegal organ harvesting by the Israeli humanitarian field clinic set up in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. A spokesperson for the U.K. Liberal Democratic Party called for a parliamentary investigation of the allegations, which were later dismissed as political propaganda from Iran and Palestine (Leyden, 2010). However, these rumors were actually fueled by the presence in Haiti of both U.S. and Israeli religious organizations that proposed airlifts and adoptions by foreign families of the alleged “tens of thousands of Haitian children” orphaned by the earthquake. Organ theft and child theft are often linked in rumors. In this instance, speculation was fueled by humanitarian interventions to rescue children whose parents were wrongly presumed to be dead in the initial chaos. ​&gt; Rumors of organ stealing have led to mob lynching of foreigners suspected of adopting poor and disabled children for their organs. Several of these rumors led to violence and international diplomatic problems in Central America and Moldova in the early 2000s. As recently as 2014 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, a woman was attacked and killed by a mob after her photo was posted on Facebook alleging that she was kidnapping stray children with the intent to kill them for their organs. ​U.S.-Mexico Borderlands and Drug and Organs Trafficking: Along the U.S. border with Mexico, a string of barrier fences was signed into law by George W. Bush and extends almost 700 miles. Whereas a great migration came from war-torn countries in the Middle East into Europe, Baja, California has war-ravaged refugees from the drug cartel–infested states of Sinaloa and Michoacán. In 2010, I contacted FBI agents about a private hospital in Baja where illegal transplants for North Americans were taking place. I also told them about a Mexican refuge, Adriana Gil, who contacted me through her partner for help in filing her complaints of kidnapping, torture, sex slavery, and child trafficking for organs at the hands of a brutal drug cartel. Then living in Riverside County in Southern California, I agreed to meet with them on the campus of UC Riverside. The story seemed outrageous, one that, under ordinary circumstances, I would have rejected at the outset. Perhaps the woman was suffering from recovered memories of some kind of trauma, but what would motivate her to call Organs Watch to go public and put herself in danger of deportation? She said that she wanted the truth to be known and for the horrendous crimes to stop. She was willing to speak with police, the FBI, or whomever I could contact. So, accompanied by my daughter, Jennifer Scheper Hughes, a UC Riverside professor of Mexican religious studies, who had been forced to leave one of her Mexican field sites following threats from a local drug cartel, we spent a day in the company of Ms. Gil and her protective companion. Her story began when she was a young mother who was held hostage as a sex slave for several years by a drug cartel. She said she was hand delivered to the cartel by her then-boyfriend and father of their two children. She had been raped repeatedly and was tortured. She showed me her scars, including burns from cigarettes and cigars. She managed to escape across the border into southern California after a drug lord named “Juan,” had groomed her to scout for children in poor schools and daycare centers and to abduct them for kidney trafficking. Although most of Adriana’s story was validated by immigration officials and by the trauma center where she was treated for symptoms of PTSD resulting from her torture, the doctors and psychiatrists could not validate her story that she was asked to scout and to kidnap small children for the drug cartel to use as they wished. While everyone from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime to the Vatican and Pope Francis have recognized organ harvesting from political refugees and from enemy combatants as crimes against humanity, the empirical forensic evidence is lacking. I was fairly certain that Adriana had been ordered to kidnap children, but for what purpose – sexual abuse, illegal adoptions or kidney trafficking - I could not verify. After my interviews with Adriana Gil, I contacted FBI agents assigned to cover the California and Mexico borderlands for human trafficking by drug cartels. I shared with the young FBI agents (with Adriana’s permission) the story of Mexico-U.S. borderland drug cartels involved in organ harvesting from children. The investigators said that they did not have the tools, the support team, or the resources to investigate Adriana’s gruesome testimony. They were convinced that it was a likely scenario, but they did not have the resources to tackle it. So, instead, I worked with a Hollywood film company that produced a second-class social thriller, the film “Inhale,” staring Sam Shepard, which was based in part on Adriana’s allegations. As I stated above, in the Organs Watch project, the real, the unreal, and the uncanny often collide. Thus, I was not surprised when in March 2014, Manuel Plancar Gaspar, a member of a drug gang known as the Knights Templar (Los Caballeros Templarios) was arrested and detained by Carlos Castellanos Becerra, the head of Seguridad Pública, in the state of Michoacán on charges of ​kidnapping children for the purpose of selling their organs. Gaspar was identified as the leader of the cartel’s organ trafficking ring. ISIS Decrees on The Right and The Duty to Kill and to Cannibalize the Body of the Enemy, the Infidels and Apostates: In the wake of allegations of executions, beheadings, and organ harvesting of kidnapped persons by ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria, one of our UC Berkeley anthropological graduate students, Khashayar Beigi, came across the website of Jihadica last February (2014) where a number of fatwas bearing ISIS insignia have been collected by a team of academicians and researchers (http:\/\/www.jihadica.com\/32-islamic-state-fatwas\/). Mostly originating from Yemen, many of these fatwas were circulated by cell phones and Twitter. These fatwas informed ISIS combatants that harvesting organs from the bodies of the enemy-infidel or removing organs from living apostates, even if this might cause their death, was permissible. The fatwas neither prove nor disprove the allegations made by the UN ambassador, but they do cast light on ISIS militants’ use of ancient and classic Islamic texts in fatwas bearing on the current wars in the Middle East. Fatwas are traditional religious decrees delivered in response to a pressing question or problem without precedence in Islamic jurisprudence. Many of the ISIS fatwas seem to deal with the administration and adjudication of a vast range of everyday life matters, such as marital arrangements, inherited property, and the permissibility of sports. However, some of the fatwas clearly show a direct engagement with inquiries specific to exceptional circumstances in the context of current wars and struggles. A fatwa is an Islamic legal pronouncement, issued by an expert in religious law (mufti), pertaining to a specific issue, usually at the request of an individual or a judge, to resolve an issue where Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), is unclear. Typically, such uncertainty arises to address new issues such as medical technologies and other biotechnologies advance. “Can a Muslim be involved in cloning?” for instance. Among the fatwas posted online were many concerned with medical circumstances during war, such as the shortage of doctors and the use of enemy bodies and organs for life-saving measures. A partial translation of the ISIS fatwa on organ transplant shows not only that bodies are being held captive in the current wars in the Middle East, but also that medical, moral, and theological teachings on life and death are being reshaped forcefully. In contrast to secular courts of law, fatwas are not binding rules unless a Muslim chooses to follow them. So, rather than seeing ISIS fatwas as enforcing individual actions or moral judgments by the religious authorities who release them, one can study fatwas as religious expert pronouncements that can shed light on the social, historical, and political circumstances in which ancient religious traditions and reasoning are applied to current social and political realities. For example, terms such as “the constrained person” (modhtar) or a “person living in exceptional times and circumstances” (idhtar) are used in fatwas to convey that the person or the subject of the fatwa is concerned with emergencies that might require a new religious decree. The application of these terms to organ harvesting during the current wartime violence and medical needs in ISIS-ruled territories shows the way in which analogical reasoning and ancient precedents drawn from traditional Islamic jurisprudence can justify cannibalizing the bodies of infidels and apostates. The violence and chaos of war, parallel to the unleashing forces of death and destruction on the ground by the states, ripple into the centuries-old fabric of Islamic medical practices - ancient codes of warfare and religious reasoning. These fatwas are forensic pronouncements on medical practices, religious traditions, and wartime conducts from the perspective of moral, theological, ​and military institutions. The fatwas seeped into the desolate wartime landscapes of amputated limbs, extracted organs, bombed residences, and beheaded corpses scattered in the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. What is being held captive in these ISIS fatwas, in addition to the bodies of political prisoners, is the normal space of intelligibility, moral reasoning, and moral conduct of Islamic jurisprudence. Fatwa No. 68 is translated by Khashayar Beigi (below). Fatwa No. 68: Question: Is it permitted to take organs of the captive apostate for those Muslims in need of it? Answer: There is no doubt that Muslim hospitals are overwhelmed with illnesses and diseases of heart, kidney, and all similar intractable conditions that threaten the afflicted with fatal and degenerative conditions, harm, and death. God Almighty knows best about the rewards of transferring the healthy organs of the apostate to the body of the Muslim to save his life or remedy the lost organs, as there is evidence in all bodies of sacred religious texts and rulings. God Almighty says, “and whoever saves one—it is as if he had saved mankind itself,” and the context of this verse is general and includes all forms of saving lives including organ transplant. The duty to save a Muslim soul from sickness and death is a religious obligation necessitating all legitimate available means. When a given means is the only way for a religious obligation to be accomplished, then that means is itself obligatory. Accordingly, the experts of the Shafi’i and Hanbali schools of Islamic jurisprudence permitted killing of the warring infidels or apostates under the constraining circumstances of eating their flesh to stay alive. Imam Alnawawi says, “There is permission to kill the warring party, the apostate, and moreover to eat their flesh carries no sanction.” If the experts of jurisprudence have allowed under war conditions believers to eat the flesh of the infidel in order to prevent harm and loss of life, these apply as well to the transplant of organs from the apostate to the Muslim. The life and organs of the apostate are not protected by Muslim jurisprudence. In short, the cannibalization of the infidel is permissible in times of war when destroyed bodies and limbs are scattered on the fields. War is hell, and under these extreme conditions when Muslim soldiers are famished in the desert, losing blood, and needing surgery, the right to life means that the body of the enemy—the apostate or the infidel—can be used to supply food, blood, and organs. It is an argument that resonates with the demands made by those individuals of all religions who travel abroad to purchase “spare” kidneys from the poor, the destitute, the displaced, and the wretched of the earth, to make themselves whole. I have applied the word “neo-cannibalism” to all illicit transplants based on the exploitation of strangers who in the minds of the buyer are mere “things” (organs) from the bodies of people who do not count, and who might as well be “infidels.” The Body of the Terrorist: Biopiracy at the Israeli Forensic Institute at Abu Kabir, Tel Aviv: There was trophy collecting of skinned tattoos taken from the bodies of Russian new immigrants and from prisoners. Tattoos were an oddity in Israel, where they are still associated with the Shoah. But, there was also a taint of suspicion about the new immigrants from the former Soviet ​bloc states, who were privately suspected of being economic refugees rather than cultural refugees, claiming a tenuous-at-best Jewish identity. As explained by Dr. Hiss, the director of the Israeli Forensic Institute, eye globes were taken from the heads and sheets of skin were taken from the backs of Palestinian combatants whose bodies would be returned to their family members in tightly bound sheets and with eyes glued shut to avoid detection. But some family members (as in the case of South Africa) carefully uncovered and inspected their “war” dead and were horrified at seeing the second death to which their loved ones had been subjected. The moral collapse at Israel’s National Forensic Institute at Abu Kabir led by the director and state-appointed senior pathologist, Jehuda Hiss, and his staff was complete, lacking any vestige of human decency in their official stewardship and protection of the bodies of the dead. The abuses were facilitated by the military conflict during and between the two intifadas, which produced abundant supplies of dead bodies from Palestinian militants, Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers, and victims of suicide bombings and military-civil emergencies. There were a hierarchy of bodies and a confusion of motives that ranged from the banal to crimes against humanity. The abuses could be arranged along a continuum, from the stockpiling of hearts, glands, long bones, and brains (even heads) for profit, for “science,” for recreation, and for power, patronage, and reputation. The stockpiling of tattoos skinned from the dead bodies of new immigrants was an act of hostility toward new immigrant refugees from former Soviet states, although linking it to a nascent form of race hatred might be going too far. A knowledgeable source from within the forensic institute pointed out that the man responsible for the tattoo collecting was himself a Russian and a Jew. The desecration of the dead bodies of Palestinian combatants is toward the far end of the continuum of medical human rights abuse: a crime against humanity. For more than two decades, the Israeli government and Ministry of Health denied “blood libel,” the accusation that the government’s state pathologists harvested organs and tissues from the bodies of “enemy” combatants, terrorists, and teenage stone-throwers from the occupied territories. In August 2009, another organ-trafficking story broke—one that linked Rosenbaum’s U.S.-Israel organ-brokering and money-laundering schemes with much older allegations of organ and tissue stealing from the bodies of Palestinian “terrorists” and stone-throwers following autopsy at Israel’s National Forensic Institute in Abu Kabir, a neighborhood of Tel Aviv. In a banner headline story, ”Our Sons Plundered for Their Organs,” in a left-leaning Swedish tabloid, Aftonbladet, Swedish journalist Donald Boström reopened these allegations dating back from the early 1990s to August 17, 2009. The story was a mix of organ theft accusations, seemingly far-fetched connections to the arrest in Brooklyn of an orthodox rabbi and transplant broker, and a dash of political rhetoric. The story, based on Boström’s earlier research in the Occupied Territories during the first intifada, and published in his 2001 book Inshallah repeats the story of family members whose killed sons and husbands were harvested at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, where they were brought for autopsy only. Boström argues that Palestinian bodies were being harvested as the “spoils of war.” The Aftonbladet story, instantly translated into Hebrew and English, created a firestorm of international protest that included a libel suit by antidefamation lawyers in New York City and a boycott of Swedish industries. Boström was labeled an anti-Semite, and the story he dredged up from the sewer was labeled a despicable “blood libel” against Israel and the world’s Jews. I read these news reports with mounting horror.(1) The only question that was not being raised in the avalanche of articles, editorials, and news columns published in Israel, Europe, and the United States was this: “Is the story true?” I knew the answer. I was in possession of the proverbial ​smoking gun: an audio-recorded interview with the director of the National Forensic Institute, Dr. Jehuda Hiss. The interview was conducted at the Institute in July 2000, when I was in Israel investigating the growth of organized transplant tours and organs trafficking by underworld brokers in Israel. A human rights lawyer in Bethlehem asked me to investigate complaints by Palestinian families about illegal harvesting of eyes, solid organs, and skin at the National Forensic Institute. I was given the photo and files of a young man whose autopsy appeared to end in dissection. In his interview with me, Dr. Hiss was open, energized, and brazen in defending his method of “informal” procurement of organs and tissues from the bodies of the dead brought to the institute for autopsy. He did so, he said, as a patriot and to serve the needs of his country. When he first arrived at the Institute in 1987 as chief pathologist, there was no organ or tissue harvesting—an absurdity, he called it. He instituted his own version of “presumed consent” for organs and tissue harvesting. That is, he presumed to know what was best for his country without the knowledge, backing, or consent of the victims, the Israeli population, or the law. It was justified behavior, he said, for a war-torn and traumatized country such as Israel. From his medical perspective as a state pathologist, little harm was done to dead bodies by the careful removal of skin, tissue, bone, and organs that would never be missed by the deceased and which could be hidden from the families of the dead. “We were very careful in peeling the skin,” he said, “it wasn’t like skinning a rabbit: We took only from the back and the back of the legs.” Special care was taken with the harvesting of Palestinians and Arab-Israelis—Christian and Muslim. Hiss explained to me without any embarrassment that his team was very careful to sew the empty eye sockets shut so the families could not see that the eye globes had been removed. When hospital pathologists were brought into Abu Kabir to assist with the organ harvesting and refused to comply, Hiss recruited plastic surgeons, and at least one was hired. Hiss was not so much “above the law,” as representing a higher law, his law, which he felt was supremely cool, rational, and scientifically and technically correct. The country was at war, blood was being spilled every day, soldiers were being burned, and yet Israelis refused to provide the tissues and organs needed. So, he took matters into his own hands. Although I discussed the interview with a lawyer for the Ministry of Health, I never published it. Fearing the unintended political consequences of making it public, I let the tape sit, more or less untouched, in my archives for 10 years. But after the Boström firestorm in 2009 and at the request of some Israeli colleagues who knew about the interview, I released the tape to Israeli TV journalists who used it as part of their own investigative report that aired in December 2009. After segments of my interview with Professor Hiss were aired on the Israeli national nightly news on Channel 2 TV, government officials for the army and the Ministry of Health admitted that organs and tissues had been harvested (without consent) from dead bodies throughout the 1990s, but that the practice had ended in 2000 (the date of my interview). Dr. Hiss, however, publicly denied everything on tape, including his words to me. Today, he denies it all: the stockpiling of body parts, the perjury in autopsy reports concerning enemy combatants and Palestinian civilians, and organ harvesting. He denies everything. He says that everything was done according to the law and that all the families consented to harvest for transplantation. No organs were taken for research, and none were ever sold. However, the Segalison Committee determined that Hiss had lied to the police investigators and that he knew that the harvesting of organs and tissues without consent was illegal. Hiss’s denials were passionately rebutted at an Organs Watch Conference in Combating the Traffic in Organs in May 2011 by a former associate of Dr. Hiss at Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, ​Dr. Chen Kugel, a retired military officer and a distinguished pathologist. Kugel reported that the situation was far worse than that which Hiss had told me about. Kugel worked as one of Professor Hiss’s younger assistants, who, as soon as he arrived at the institute in 1999, pointed out to his superior that his behavior was deviant. Kugel dared to tell his boss that it was wrong to harvest organs and tissues without permission and that “giving false evidence in court about autopsies conducted there” was also “not okay.” Kugel and three other doctors from the institute wrote a letter of complaint to the Ministry of Health, outlining the illegalities. The Ministry of Health reacted with alacrity: They fired the three residents and punished Kugel, who, as a military officer working for the IDF, could not be fired. Then the four told the entire story to the media. In other words, the story of criminal behavior at the Abu Kabir institute was an old story, long known to the population, and the false alarm about the Boström report was disingenuous. Organ theft at the Institute was a dirty, public secret, and one to be kept inside the borders of Israel. According to Kugel, “The organs procured there were sold to anyone; anyone that wanted organs just had to pay for them.” While skin, heart valves, bones, and corneas were removed and sent to hospitals to be used for transplants and other medical procedures, solid organs (hearts, brains, and livers) “were sold for research, for medical presentations, for drills (training) for medical students and surgeons.” There was a low price for these organs—just $300 for a femur, for example—and should a client want all of the organs from a body, or a full range of solid organs taken from several different bodies, that, too, could be arranged, Kugel said, for about $2,500. From whom were the organs taken? They were taken from everyone, from Jews and Muslims, from soldiers and from stone-throwers, from terrorists and from the victims of terrorists, from tourists, and from recent immigrants. There were only two considerations: the physical condition of the body and its organs, and the ability of the forensic team to conceal what they were doing. Some victims were not even subject to autopsy: They were simply harvested. Organs removed with the sole purpose of distributing them for use in medical research—hearts, for example—were in great demand and had to be complete. Dissection of the heart for the purpose of autopsy would render it useless for medical research. According to Kugel, any hearts that were retained (and stockpiled for sale and distribution) were removed illegally in each case. The forensic team hid the damage by placing pipes, glass eyes, broomsticks, toilet paper, and plastic skullcaps to cover the place where the solid organs or the brain was removed. The institute, Kugel said, was counting on one thing: that most Israelis do not view the body after death except once, to verify that the body is the correct one. The body is wrapped in a winding sheet, or might be wrapped in plastic sheets in preparation for the burial company to take it. In that case, the staff would warn the burial employees, who were not well educated, not to open the sheet because the body was contaminated with an infectious disease. It was more difficult to take organs from soldiers, because their bodies were supervised by the military, which was more difficult to fool. “But even so, organs were taken from soldiers,” Kugel said. It was easier to take tissues and organs from the new immigrants, and, needless to say, easiest of all to take from the Palestinians. They would be going back across the border, and, “if there were any complaints coming from their families, they were the enemy and so, of course, they were lying and who would believe them?” The motives had nothing at all to do with science. According to Kugel, the illicit harvesting was about power and immunity. In the end, the hoarding and trading in body specimens and the stockpiling of organs, long bones, sheets of skin, and solid organs turned the National Forensic Institute into a factory of bodies. It was motivated, Kugel argues, by a traditional authoritarian paternalism of the kind that says: “We know what’s good for you, we can and we will decide what happens to you, the dead person doesn’t know anything. We alone will decide.” Chen Kugel asserted that the organ theft did not end in 1999, the time of my interview with the director of the ​institute. Rather, the practice was routinized and continued through 2011, when the police finally raided the institute. Among the dozen civil lawsuits that have been filed against Dr. Hiss, some concern the desecrated bodies of Israeli soldiers. These suits are given the greatest attention because, in Israel, the body of the soldier is at the top of a hierarchy of bodies in the nation, as in the forensic Institute. There are, as of yet, no suits from the Occupied Territories against the Institute. Perhaps the families have other concerns about the dead and their offspring that are more pressing. Among the victims are both Israeli and Palestinian soldiers, Israeli citizens who were killed in suicide bombings, and the body of an American activist from Oregon, Rachel Corrie, who was crushed to death on March 16, 2003, by an IDF Caterpillar bulldozer. She was killed while demonstrating in Gaza against the demolition of Palestinian homes when the tank plowed into her. Her body was taken to Abu Kabir and subjected to autopsy during which “body samples” and organs were taken and “misplaced” according to Dr. Hiss’s testimony in court. In 2012, government investigators and police descended on the Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir and discovered 8,200 stockpiled body parts. Finally, the government recognized that the illicit and free-for-all harvesting had become a norm and that it was criminal, unethical, and had to be acknowledged; that families had to be compensated; and that the bones, tissues, organs, and other body parts had to identified and returned to the victims’ families. Jehuda Hiss, who was once praised and rewarded as a national hero and paid the highest federal salary in the nation, was suddenly recognized as a criminal. Finally, Hiss was forced to retire, although he kept his full pension, if not his reputation. He was forced to leave his position as director of Abu Kabir. Today, Hiss’s lawyers are actively defending him in dozens of individual and collective lawsuits by Israeli families of his victims. Most are the parents of soldiers killed on duty who were subject to what Boström thought was only the plunder of the enemy. He has not, however, been prosecuted by the state for fraud, deceit, organs trafficking, violation of Israeli organ and tissue laws, or any other federal crimes. Like the complicit and corrupt Pope Benedict XVI (Scheper-Hughes, 2015) Hiss was allowed to go silently into the night with his pension, but who knows how well either of these two men are able to sleep at night. Such was the case at Abu Kabir, the term used by Israeli people to refer to the National Institute of Forensic Medicine in the neighborhood of Abu Kabir, Tel Aviv. The elegant building housed a genetics and DNA lab on the top floor that was clean, pure, and completely segregated from the morgue in the basement. Those on the third floor did not know what crimes were being committed beneath the clean scientific labs of which they were so proud. What explains the complicity of the medical technicians and possibly even medical surgeons and pathologists? Perhaps, during the worst times of political conflict, there is a moral dispensation and even a belief that the desecration of the prisoner of war or the dead body of the enemy combatant is morally justified or even necessary. One thinks of many other similar cases, such as the behavior of U.S. soldiers in the prison at Abu Ghraeb. The Israeli government dismissed the allegations against the Israeli Forensic Institute as anti-Semitic blood libels against the state of Israel. To this day it is a sensitive issue, and Israeli transplant surgeons and prosecutors tend to dismiss the painful history of the Institute to this day. When I began my independent investigations of the Forensic Institute on the basis of files I had been given by the lawyers at the St. Ives Institute in Bethlehem, which contained forensic files and photos of young men who had been killed during and between the two intifadas known as Abu Kabir in 2000, I was unaware that Swedish journalist Donald Boström and an independent internal whistle-blower, Dr. Chen Kugel, an Israeli forensic pathologist and a military officer, had also been working independently and behind the scenes. Boström worked with family members ​of the dead in Gaza, while Kugel worked with younger pathologists at the Forensic Institute to end the criminal plunder of the dead and the stockpiling of body parts there. These “perversions” at the National Forensic Institute filled Dr. Kugel with righteous anger at human rights abuses of the dead by public officials whose obligations were to be the dead person’s final guardians. Kugel paid a heavy price for his interventions. He was forced out of his position at the National Institute and was treated as a traitor and a social leper, he told me. But, in the end, the constrained but necessary sharing of information among us resulted in a difficult and unlikely collaboration between a Swedish journalist (who was labeled an anti-Semitic blood libeler), a “militant” American anthropologist, and the Israeli Zionist pathologist and military officer. The turnabout began in mid-December 2009, when I called Donald Bostrom in Sweden. He picked up the phone and heard the voice of a stranger saying, “My name is Nancy Scheper-Hughes, and your story in the Swedish newspaper is true.” “Who is this person that is speaking?” Boström asked. Boström said that when I qualified who I was and said, “I have the evidence, an hour taped interview with Dr. Jehuda Hiss admitting that he was harvesting organs, tissues, skin, long bones and other body parts that were stockpiled and sold that will play tomorrow, December 1, on Channel 2 news in Israel,” he collapsed with relief. Subsequently, Dr. Kugel and I presented a scientific paper in Vienna, and Jared Cohen invited Kugel, Boström, and myself to a Google Ideas conference on Illicit Networks. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and the Israeli government concluded their own internal investigations that led to the forced retirement of Yehuda Hess and the unanticipated appointment of Dr. Chen Kugel as his successor. One Body: “The dead body has rights and a dignity of its own,” Kugel said firmly as he took my Israeli colleague, anthropologist Meir Weiss, and my research assistant, Zvika, on a private tour of the “new” Forensic Institute and Ministry of Health, including a visit to the forensic morgue in the basement of Abu Kabir in 2013, now under his direction. “Other mistakes or bad things may happen here, as in any forensic institution,” Kugel said as he rolled out a dead body from its refrigerated cubby. “But these bodies under my care will be safe from illicit harvesting. It won’t matter if they are Jewish bodies, Muslim bodies, Christian bodies, Israeli bodies, or Palestinian bodies, foreign guest worker bodies, or Russian bodies. There is only one body here, and they are all treated in the same way.” The body of the dead is not nothing, Kugel said. A dead body is not simply an evacuated object. Kugel often substituted the word “person” for the body of the dead and never used the words “corpse” and “cadaver.” “Dead bodies matter” could be his political slogan. The dead body was, in his view, a precious “someone” to his or her parents, siblings, partners, and other loved ones. The body had a history and a life. The dead bodies had grieving relatives. There are no hierarchies of dead persons. He said that the choice to practice forensic pathology meant that the pathologist and the dead were joined at the hip, joined at the heart, the lung, and the skin. What happened during those two decades of corruption of the morgue was a violation of the body politic. It was an evil, a term most secular Israelis reserve for the Shoah, for terrorist bombings, and for suicide attacks. Translated into secular language, the dismemberment, disarticulation, distribution, and the stockpiling of skin, bones, organs, genitals, and tissues of the dead were indeed to Dr. Kugel a crime against humanity. The violations of the bodies and illegal extraction of organs and tissues of political prisoners, the mentally disabled, and the enemy derive from a mix of a militarized and contested interpretation of ancient religious beliefs, corruption, indifference, greed, and the violation of civil and medical human rights. Despite our attempt to maintain a neutral position, one may be an anthropologist to the bone and still reserve the right to protest. The allegations against ISIS may be false, based on rumors and the worst fears of what can possibly happen to the enemy-combatant. They may have even been invented by the ISIS propaganda machine. Nonetheless, the wanton harvesting of the dead bodies of the enemy is not only a war crime or a crime against humanity in which normative morality is suspended. It may signal a dangerous hour for humanity when in the words of Jan Gross (2001) writing about the systematic butchery, torture, and burning alive of 1,600 Jewish men, women, and children in the Polish town of Jedwabne on July 10, 1941 “the devil enters history.” Like Boström, I was greeted on an Organs Watch visit to Israel in 2003 with an ugly headline and centerfold (“New Blood Libel on French TV: Israel Steals Kidneys of Orphan Children in Moldova”) in Makor Rishon, a right-wing tabloid. The feature story reviewed a TV documentary by French filmmaker Catherine Bentellier, “Kidneys Worth Their Weight in Gold,” that followed my research in Moldova, Turkey, and Israel. In Moldova, we interviewed people in villages that had been ravaged by human traffickers recruiting young men to Turkey, the Ukraine, and Georgia to provide kidneys to Israeli transplant patients. The “blood libel” accusation featured medieval woodcuts and a blurry photo of me holding the hand of a Moldovan orphan in his crib, during which I described the scandal of kidney selling in Moldova and its links to child trafficking that were sometimes merged in journalistic stories (as they had been in Brazil).

The Child Organ Trafficking Rumor: A Report Submitted to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. by Todd Leventhal, United States Information Agency, Washington D.C., 1994. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Since January 1987, rumors that children are being kidnapped so that they can be used as unwilling donors in organ transplants have been rampant in the world media. No government, international body, non-governmental organization, or investigative journalist has ever produced any credible evidence to substantiate this story, however. Instead, there is every reason to believe that the child organ trafficking rumor is a modern “urban legend,” a false story that is commonly believed because it encapsulates, in story form, widespread anxieties about modern life. Organ transplant experts agree that it would be impossible to successfully conceal any clandestine murder-for-organ-trafficking ring. Because of the large number of people who must be involved in an organ transplant, the sophisticated medical technology needed to conduct such operations, the extremely short amount of time that organs remain viable for transplant, and the abhorrent nature of the alleged activities, such operations could neither be organized clandestinely nor be kept secret. Despite the impossibility of such practices occurring, and the fact that no credible evidence has ever been produced to substantiate rumors of such activities, the child organ trafficking myth has attained unprecedented credibility during the past year. It was given credence in British\/Canadian and French television documentaries, a book published in Spain, a paper by the director of the World Organization Against Torture, a resolution by the European Parliament, numerous press articles, and the January 14, 1994 report of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography. None of these sources contains any credible evidence of child organ trafficking, however. The British\/Canadian television program “The Body Parts Business” contains numerous inaccuracies. It falsely claims that the only person who investigated child organ trafficking allegations in Guatemala was murdered. In fact, such allegations were investigated on several occasions by people who remain alive. They found no evidence of child organ trafficking. “The Body Parts Business” cites the claim of Charlie Alvarado, an eight year-old Honduran child, that he was kidnapped for use in organ transplants. But it neglects to mention that the child’s accusations were dismissed by a Honduran court and appear to have been a fabrication. The program also includes the claim that Pedro Reggi had his corneas forcibly removed when he was a patient at the Montes de Oca mental institution in Argentina. Four days after this claim was broadcast, it was retracted by Mr. Reggi’s family when an expert medical examination established that Mr. Reggi had lost his eyesight due to disease. The French television program “Organ Snatchers” also cites the false Reggi claim. It also includes the claim that a Colombian boy named Jeison had his corneas forcibly removed. This claim was disproved when an examination of Jeison’s medical records established that, as an infant, he had lost his eyesight due to disease. A September 1993 European Parliament resolution also gave credence to allegations of child organ trafficking. It was unfortunately based on an August 1992 article in “Le Monde Diplomatique” that was full of inaccuracies, including many claims that had been disproved or repudiated years earlier. A March 1994 paper by the director of the World Organization Against Torture also gave credence to the child organ trafficking rumors. Like the European Parliament resolution, it was based on inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims made by others, many of which had been shown to be groundless. It also contained glaring misstatements about the organ transplantation system in the United States. A May 1994 book “Ninos de Repuesto” (“Spare-Parts Children”) relied heavily on media accounts that included numerous misstatements. Like all other treatments of this issue, it contained no credible evidence of child organ trafficking. In July 1994, a week-long series of articles in the Brazilian newspaper “Correio Braziliense” repeated the Pedro Reggi and Jeison stories, both of which had been discredited months earlier. It also included unsubstantiated charges that child organ trafficking had occurred in Brazil. The Brazilian government pledged to investigate but also announced that its investigation of previous charges of child organ trafficking had uncovered no evidence to support those charges. In August 1994, international wire services reported that four Philippine doctors had been charged with murdering a man for his organs. Subsequent press articles in the Philippines, which were not reported by the wire services, stated that the man had been declared brain dead before his organs had been removed. (Addendum to report: On December 28, 1994, a Philippine court ruled in the doctors’ favor, dismissing the charges against them.) In September 1994, Italian Minister for the Family Antonio Guidi was mistakenly quoted as confirming the child organ trafficking rumor, in a story that spread to several countries. The circulation of false reports of child organ trafficking has done enormous damage. Most dramatically, in March and April 1994, several U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries were attacked by mobs in Guatemala who believed the false rumor. One U.S. woman, June Weinstock, was severely injured and remains critically impaired. The rumor has also harmed and disrupted intercountry adoption, caused widespread, groundless fears in Latin America and elsewhere, and poses the danger of causing numerous premature deaths if it leads to a decrease in voluntary organ donation. This has already happened in the field of tissue donations. In early 1994, cornea donations in Colombia decreased by 90 percent after the false charges of cornea theft in “Organ Snatchers” were publicized in that country. Given the total lack of evidence for the child organ trafficking myth, its impossibility from a technical point of view, and the widespread, serious damage that it has already caused and is likely to cause in the future, the United States Information Agency respectfully requests that the U.N. Special Rapporteur give maximum attention and publicity to the information in this report, which demonstrates the groundlessness of reports of child organ trafficking and the impossibility of such practices occurring. Otherwise, more innocent people may become victims of this deadly rumor. INTRODUCTION: The United States Information Agency (USIA) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the request of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography for material to assist him in preparing his upcoming report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. In its reply, the United States Information Agency wishes to draw special attention to one aspect of the Special Rapporteur’s area of inquiry: the alleged sale of children for the purpose of organ transplantation. The U.S. Information Agency has investigated allegations of trafficking in children’s organs since these charges first appeared in the world press in January 1987. In addition to its own investigations, the U.S. Information Agency has also attempted to learn about the results of examinations of this issue by intergovernmental bodies such as the United Nations and the European Parliament, and by other governments, non-governmental organizations, and investigative journalists. Despite almost eight years of exhaustive inquiries involving numerous allegations, the U.S. Information Agency is not aware of any credible evidence produced by any of these investigations that indicates that any trafficking in children’s organs has ever occurred. On the contrary, all the information points to the opposite conclusion: that allegations of trafficking in children’s organs are a totally unfounded myth. In examining this issue, the U.S. Information Agency has not restricted its interest to claims of trafficking in children’s organs allegedly involving U.S. citizens, but rather has sought to establish whether there is any truth to any of the child organ trafficking reports, regardless of whether or not they involve U.S. citizens. As stated above, we are not aware of any credible evidence that would indicate that trafficking in children’s organs is a real phenomenon. A MODERN “URBAN LEGEND”: Rumors of child organ trafficking appear to be a modern “urban legend,” a false story that is commonly believed despite the total lack of evidence for it because it encapsulates, in story form, widespread anxieties about modern life. Many present-day urban legends revolve around fears of modern technology. For example, apprehensions about microwave ovens gave rise to the widely believed tale about the person who tried to dry a wet dog in a microwave oven, only to have it explode! Another postulates that the oil companies have invented a super-efficient carburetor that enables cars to drive enormous distances on a tiny amount of gasoline, but are preventing this invention from being sold in order to maintain their sales. Despite the lack of evidence for these urban legends, and the fact that they are insupportable when subjected to rational scrutiny, these myths achieve their credibility because they give voice, form, and substance to unarticulated anxieties or suspicions. Rumors of child organ trafficking have achieved widespread credibility in just such fashion. This myth embodies, in fable form, some of the most potent anxieties of modern life: fear of and resentment at wealthy foreigners who are perceived as extremely powerful, and, at a even more visceral level, fear of wrongful mutilation and death, which has subconsciously been stimulated by the dramatic advances that have occurred during the past ten to fifteen years in the field of organ transplantation. The huge advances that have been made in organ transplantation in recent years have been due to the development of drugs that counteract the body’s natural tendency to reject a transplanted organ as a foreign body. This has been a great boon and has saved the lives of tens of thousands of people who otherwise would have died prematurely. Yet, paradoxically, this life-giving process, which has brought happiness to so many, has also stirred dark, primordial fears. These were perhaps best encapsulated in the best-selling 1977 book “Coma” by Robin Cook, which was made into a movie by Michael Crichton in 1978. In “Coma,” unsuspecting people needing medical treatment are placed in a coma so that their organs can be extracted and the lives of others prolonged. The popularity of this fictional thriller was evidence of the deep anxieties that modern advances in organ transplantation have stimulated. Since then, there have been numerous fictional works that have featured the organ theft theme. In the real world, as opposed to the world of fiction, as organ transplantation procedures have advanced in various countries, they have been accompanied by the development of elaborate ethical guidelines, designed to guard against possible abuses, to ensure fairness in allocating organs, to prohibit the sale of organs, and to protect the rights and sensitivities of those involved in the transplant process. As the practice of organ transplantation spreads to more countries, guidelines governing it have been adopted more widely. Laws forbidding the sale of organs for transplant now exist in approximately 50 countries and non- statutory measures aimed at accomplishing the same purpose are present in nine countries. But not even the most elaborate, carefully constructed safeguards can quiet all anxieties. Many people remain anxious about imagined dangers from organ transplantation. In the United States, these concerns usually are expressed in the form of the “kidney heist” myth, as Jan Brunvand, a folklorist at the University of Utah, described it in his 1993 book “The Baby Train.” In this tale’s typical form, a man meets an attractive woman at a bar while visiting a large city, often said to be New York. After trying to take advantage of the amorous situation, the victim awakes the next day in his hotel room, dazed and in pain, and discovers, to his horror, that one of his kidneys has been removed. Sometimes, this incident is alleged to have happened in the gambling center of Las Vegas, after the victim has enlisted the services of a prostitute. In a third version, a homeless person is the victim. This modern urban legend, which Brunvand says embodies a “crime and punishment” theme, is widely believed in the United States. Swedish folklorist Bengt af Klintberg has written a book on various urban legends called “Den Stulna Njuren” (“The Stolen Kidney”), named after this tale. In the European versions of the story, travelling Europeans have their kidneys stolen after being at a bar in Bangkok, Thailand, in Brazil, in the Istanbul bazaar, in the Balkans, or in North Africa. Klintberg says that some versions of the legend claim that there are “organ-snatching gangs” that commit the alleged crime, although he notes that this is “much more extensive in German-speaking countries than in Scandinavia.” The rumors also change over time. Klintberg notes, with regard to the organ-snatching gangs story, that “places like Tunis, Venice or Spain figure in the earliest version, but since the fall of 1991, cities closer to Germany’s borders, like Amsterdam, Venlo, or Strausbourg, are also mentioned.” He adds: “In the beginning of 1993, many Germans were so worried about this story being true that the newspapers had to publish denials.” The child organ trafficking myth is the version of the “kidney heist” rumor that is most prevalent in Latin America and other areas outside Europe and North America. “Rich foreigners” or a shadowy “organ mafia” are the alleged villains in this scenario. Instead of adult males being victimized in distant and dangerous large cities, children are the alleged victims in this scenario. This may be connected, in part, with the recent dramatic rise in intercountry adoptions, as many Europeans or North Americans have adopted children from Latin America or East Asia. Or it may simply be due to the fact that children, as the most vulnerable members of any group, are a natural focus of myths involving fears and anxieties. In a special January 1990 issue of “Western Folklore” entitled “Contemporary Legends in Emergence,” French folklorist Veronique Campion-Vincent wrote that the child organ trafficking myth: is a new – updated and technologized – version of an immemorial fable. The core of the fable is that a group’s children are being kidnapped and murdered by evil outsiders. Accusations of such kidnappings and ritual murders were made against Christians in ancient Rome (and against) Jews throughout antiquity, the Middle Ages, and up to modern times…. Child abductions in 18th century France were explained by ailing nobility who needed them for medical reasons: the leprous King needed blood baths, or a mutilated Prince needed a new arm which incompetent surgeons were trying each day to graft from a new kidnapped child. THE RUMOR ENTERS THE WORLD PRESS: Folklorists have instantly recognized the child organ trafficking myth for what it is – a modern urban legend that is widely believed despite the fact that it is not true. But, in 1987, the child organ trafficking myth escaped from the usual realm of folklore, which is passed by word-of-mouth, and began to appear in the mass media worldwide. This watershed event occurred in Honduras in January 1987, when the former Secretary General of the Honduran Committee for Social Welfare, Leonardo Villeda Bermudez, mentioned the rumor during an interview in a way that made it appear as if it was true. Mr. Villeda immediately issued a clarification stating that he had merely heard unconfirmed rumors of such activities. All top Honduran officials, including the President’s wife, emphasized that there was no evidence for such allegations, but by this time the rumor had been reported by the Reuters wire service and it began to circulate throughout the media worldwide, appearing in Guatemala the next month and soon afterwards in Europe. The transformation from word-of-mouth urban legend to mass media misinformation had begun. In April 1987, the Soviet disinformation apparatus began a conscious effort to spread and embellish the child organ trafficking story. On April 5, 1987, “Pravda” carried the three-month old Honduran story, citing the original allegations without mentioning subsequent press accounts dismissing the story. TASS replayed the story, and during 1987 and 1988 it appeared many times in the Soviet media and in pro-Soviet media worldwide. Occasional disinformation – deliberate lies or distortions undertaken for a political purpose – still occurs. The Cubans continue to press the child organ trafficking story, having repeatedly tried to introduce resolutions on this issue in U.N. human rights meetings. One formerly Soviet-controlled front group, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, has continued to try to foster the rumor, particularly through its status as a non-governmental organization accredited to the United Nations. In addition, some anti-U.S. extremists, from the far left in some countries and the far right in other countries, have embraced the rumor enthusiastically, perhaps because it fits with their anti- U.S. political agenda. Although political motivations have been responsible for some of the more spectacular outbursts of the child organ trafficking rumor, for the most part, the rumor has been embraced and spread by well-meaning individuals who believe it out of naivete or worry that it may be true. Tragically, the publicity these well-intentioned individuals have given the rumor by deploring a non-existent crime has inadvertently contributed to its credibility and the resultant damage it has done. At this point, the rumor has attained such currency that it appears certain to continue on the strength of its own momentum for years to come. THE RUMOR’S ADVERSE EFFECTS: The continued circulation of unfounded child organ trafficking rumors has done great harm in a number of ways. Most dramatically, it led to unprovoked, violent attacks on U.S. citizens and others in Guatemala during March and April 1994. On March 8, a mob in the Guatemalan town of Santa Lucia Cotzumalaguapa burned the police station in which an U.S. woman wrongly suspected of kidnapping a child for organ trafficking, Melissa Larson, had been held. The mob resisted the efforts of several hundred riot police and was not quieted until army troops and armored vehicles arrived to restore order. Fortunately, Ms. Larson was not harmed. In the wake of this attack, on March 13, the Guatemalan newspaper “Prensa Libre” published an extremely inflammatory article by Mario David Garcia. The headline of the article was: “Children are frequently purchased to mutilate them.” The article falsely accused “developed countries” of stealing human organs from Latin America. It falsely claimed that “in order to obtain human grafts, the worst extremes have been used: assassination, kidnapping, and mutilation.” It falsely accused “Europeans, Americans and Canadians” of posing as “tourists” in order to conceal their alleged involvement in “activities that range from the purchase of children to kidnapping” in order to procure organs for transplant. The article, which offered no substantiation for any of its wild claims, was accompanied by an illustration showing the alleged prices for which various organs were supposedly selling on the international market. The “Prensa Libre” article was posted in the town square of the village of San Cristobal Verapaz, where, on March 29, another U.S. tourist, June Weinstock, was savagely beaten by a mob who wrongly accused her of abducting a Guatemalan child for the purpose of organ trafficking. A mob surrounded the building in San Cristobal Verapaz where Ms. Weinstock was being protected by local authorities, broke in, and dragged her out after a five-hour siege. Ms. Weinstock was pelted with rocks and beaten with pieces of firewood. She suffered multiple broken bones, internal injuries, and severe head injuries that have caused serious, long-term damage. An American citizen living in San Cristobal who had acted as a translator for Ms. Weinstock, Michael Lewis, was also beaten, although not as severely. As of late November 1994, Ms. Weinstock remained severely disabled in a long-term care facility. Although it appeared that she was aware of what was going on around her, she was not able to speak, walk, or do anything for herself, although she was breathing on her own and had been for some time. She was receiving speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and required complete, 24-hour nursing supervision. On April 13, Janice Vogel, an American woman who was adopting a Guatemalan child, was accosted by a mob in Guatemala City who accused her of stealing the child for organ trafficking. Fortunately, she was not harmed. In addition to assaults on U.S. citizens, the Guatemalan media have reported numerous attempted lynchings by angry mobs who feared that “strangers” were stealing their children for organ trafficking. A Swiss volcanologist, a Salvadoran family visiting relatives, foreign assistance workers, backpackers, and Guatemalan citizens all reportedly suffered such attacks. The attacks in Guatemala were the subject of a special feature on the U.S. television newsmagazine program “20\/20” on June 3, 1994. It contains graphic footage of the attacks on the four Americans and should be viewed by any who doubt the destructive power of the child organ trafficking rumor. In addition to provoking attacks on foreigners, the hysteria generated by the child organ trafficking rumor has also had an adverse impact on intercountry adoptions in a number of countries. For example, in May 1991, the Turkish government announced that it was suspending intercountry adoptions because of the rumor. After false rumors of child organ trafficking were publicized in Brazil in late 1993, only 36 adoptions were completed during the first half of 1994 in the Pernambuco region, as opposed to 300 during the first half of 1993. Intercountry adoptions have also been suspended or hindered in Honduras, Guatemala, and other countries. As a result, some children who might have found loving homes remained in orphanages. Belief in the false rumor is now so widespread that one country, Bulgaria, requires foreigners who wish to adopt a Bulgarian child to sign a notarized form pledging that “I will not permit my child to be an organ donor nor allow the child to give organs or be a part of any medical experiments.” The child organ trafficking rumor has also led to groundless, but widespread fears among parents in Latin America and elsewhere who fear that their children may be kidnapped for the purpose of organ transplantation. Finally, the rumor may also lead to a serious loss of life by decreasing the supply of donated organs. Voluntary organ donation is prompted by altruism, and can be adversely affected by any perception of impropriety or illicit behavior. In many countries, the waiting lists for various organs exceed donor supply and, as a result, people die every day because of the lack of sufficient donor organs. To the extent the organ trafficking rumor is believed, it may decrease voluntary organ donation, and thereby cost lives. This has already happened with regard to the donation of corneas, which are tissues, not organs. After false charges of cornea theft in Colombia were publicized in a French television program in November 1993, cornea donations in Colombia plummeted, decreasing by 90 percent, according to the Pan-American Association of Eye Banks. Prior to the broadcast of the false charges, cornea donations in Colombia averaged 94 per month, but dropped to 8 to 10 per month after the program. As a result, the list of people in Colombia waiting to have their eyesight restored by corneal transplants increased from 250 to 878. Even if false charges of child organ trafficking cause a decrease in organ donation that is less precipitous, precious lives will be lost unnecessarily. In the view of the U.S. Information Agency, the extremely adverse effects of this rumor, particularly those involving violent attacks on innocent bystanders and the potential loss of life from decreased organ donation, impose severe moral constraints on those who are inclined to repeat these rumors uncritically. Before the attacks in March and April 1994, it was plausible, although, in the opinion of the U.S. Information Agency, incorrect to argue that the greater good was served by calling attention to these rumors, even if they could not be confirmed. This approach entailed serious risks, however. Regrettably, the unjustified credibility given to child organ trafficking rumors by journalists, government officials in several countries, several non-governmental organizations (in particular, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers), the European Parliament, and the U.N. Special Rapporteur may well have played a significant role in creating the atmosphere that led to violent attacks on U.S. citizens and others in Guatemala in 1994. Moreover, the threat of further unwarranted attacks and of premature deaths due to decreased organ donations remains ever present. Given the violence that this false rumor has caused and the serious threat that it poses to the extremely fragile system of voluntary organ donation, the U.S. Information Agency believes that it is incumbent upon all observers, in particular the Special Rapporteur, to subject allegations of child organ trafficking to the most careful and skeptical scrutiny. 1993-1994: THE RUMOR ATTAINS UNPRECEDENTED CREDIBILITY: The need for objective and responsible reporting on this issue has never been greater in light of the unprecedented credibility that the child organ trafficking rumor has achieved during the past year. Since September 1993, the rumor has been given credence in British\/Canadian and French television documentaries, a book published in Spain, a paper presented by the director of the World Organization Against Torture, a resolution by the European Parliament, numerous press articles, and the January 14, 1994 report of the Special Rapporteur, which claimed that there is “mounting evidence of a market for children’s organs.” (E\/CN.4\/1994\/84, page 23). The U.S. Information Agency has examined the allegations made in all of these television programs, books, reports, and resolutions, and has found no credible evidence of child organ trafficking in any of them. A detailed examination of each item follows. “THE BODY PARTS BUSINESS”: The British\/Canadian television program “The Body Parts Business” was broadcast in Britain on November 21, 1993 and in Canada on November 22, 1993. It was produced by Judy Jackson of Alma Associates Ontario Ltd. in Toronto, Canada, and narrated by Bruce Harris, who works for Covenant House in Central America. The program was funded by the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Canadian National Film Board. The program examines alleged organ and tissue trafficking abuses in Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, and Russia. With regard to Guatemala, the program claims that the only person in that country who investigated organ trafficking rumors was murdered, thus giving the impression that anyone who investigates these allegations in Guatemala is likely to be killed, presumably by a ruthless mafia-like organization that will do anything to prevent exposure of its clandestine operations. This claim is not accurate. There have been several investigations of organ trafficking allegations in Guatemala since 1986 and the people involved in them remain quite alive. It is also worth noting that these investigations found no evidence of child organ trafficking. For example, in the November 18, 1988 issue of Guatemala’s “Diario de Centro America,” then- Guatemalan President Cerezo stated: “The Guatemalan government has made serious and thorough investigations on the trafficking of babies and it has been concluded that the rumors on the `butchering’ of babies are false.” In 1987 and 1988, when child organ trafficking charges erupted in the Guatemalan press, the U.S. embassy in Guatemala contacted the Guatemalan authorities to see if they had any information to substantiate these claims. They did not. In both years, the Guatemalan authorities stated that they had absolutely no evidence that would authenticate the organ trafficking claims. In February 1987, the chief of the Guatemalan Treasury Police, Colonel Guillermo Echeverria Vielman, stated that he had “no indication” that children were being used as organ donors. Subsequently, Baudillo Hichos Lopez, the chief of the narcotics and intelligence section of the Treasury Police, who had been quoted in the press as claiming that child organ trafficking existed, stated, in an October 26, 1987 letter to the U.S. embassy’s public affairs officer, “at no time did I make the scandalous and compromising statements of the kind you cited.” In 1988, after new allegations of child organ trafficking had arisen, Oscar Augusto Dias Urquizi, Director General of the Guatemalan Treasury Police, stated, on January 29, 1988: “the institution which I direct has no proof, evidence, or indication that Guatemalan children are being sent to the United States, or to any other country, to be dismembered and used as organ donors.” By failing to mention any of these Guatemalan government investigations, “The Body Parts Business” gives the misleading impression that these allegations are too dangerous to examine. In the next section of “The Body Parts Business,” on Honduras, the program includes the claim of eight year-old Charlie Alvarado that he was kidnapped by foreigners who wanted to sell his organs, but luckily escaped after four days. But the program fails to include other important information that indicates that Alvarado’s claim was a hoax. Spiegel television in Germany also examined the Charlie Alvarado case and allegations of child organ trafficking in Honduras, which were rampant in that country in April 1993. According to a June 20, 1993 Spiegel television broadcast on this subject, an investigation of Alvarado’s claims by the Honduran courts “revealed that Charlie’s story was a fabrication.” Alvarado could not remember the day on which he was allegedly kidnapped, he had no bruises from the ropes with which he claimed he had been bound tightly for days, and the two foreign workers he accused of kidnapping him were released for lack of evidence. “The Body Parts Business” includes none of this information, which is essential in order to properly evaluate Alvarado’s claims. The third section of “The Body Parts Business” examines Argentina. It highlights the case of Pedro Reggi, who claimed that his corneas were forcibly removed when he was a patient at the Montes de Oca mental institution in Argentina. On November 25, 1993, four days after “The Body Parts Business” first aired in Britain, the Reggi claim was repudiated live on the “Hora Clave” television program in Argentina. Pedro Reggi appeared on that program, accompanied by his half-brother Mario Barretto. Mr. Barretto spoke, presumably because of Mr. Reggi’s mental deficiencies. He stated: I came here to refute those reports about organ trafficking. Today, we took him to a highly qualified institution, to have Pedro’s eyes examined. I was told it was the result of an infection that, instead of spreading throughout his body, spread to his eyes. There is no cure, because his eyes have shrunk…. Later on the program, Mr. Barretto revealed the apparent origin of the false Reggi claim, stating, “That was my idea, that they might well have taken his corneas.” Subsequently, the Reggi case was investigated further. In a December 6, 1993 letter to the director of Argentina’s Lagleyze Hospital, formerly the national ophthalmology hospital, Dr. Patricia Rey stated that Reggi suffered from “bilateral congenital cataracts” as an infant, and in the mid-1980s suffered from nystagmus (a rhythmic oscillation of the eyeballs) in both eyes, the cornea of his right eye contained “intraparenchymatous deposits” and showed “peripheral neovascularization,” and his left eye showed a “regenerative cataract.” Surgery to try to improve visual acuity was abandoned in 1985 when it was observed that in his left eye “the anterior chamber was filled and the cornea was infiltrated.” In short, the Reggi claim arose from unwarranted suspicions, perhaps stimulated by press reports of organ trafficking allegations. The claim appears to have been made in earnest, but the makers of “The Body Parts Business” do not appear to have sought to verify its validity before including it in their program. As a result, even though the Reggi claim was immediately disproved, the vast majority of people who are aware of this case are under the false impression that Reggi is a genuine victim of forced corneal removal and living proof that such practices occur. In reality, he lost his vision due to disease. According to an article in the November 27, 1993 issue of the Argentine newspaper “Pagina 12,” the director of the Argentine Transplant Society, the director of the Argentine National Institute of Ablations and Implants (INCUCAI), and other top Argentine transplant authorities stated emphatically that “an organ market does not exist in Argentina” and charged that what “The Body Parts Business” claimed, with regard to Argentina, was “a lie.” They also noted that previous accusations of improper transplant activities in the Cordoba region of Argentina had “caused a 90 percent decrease in (organ) donors” in that area. On November 23, 1993, an article in “Pagina 12” cited Argentine Minister of Health Julio Cesar Araoz as stating, “I cannot claim with certainty that trafficking in organs really existed ….” Araoz also noted that Juan Martin Romero Victorica, who had led the investigation of the Montes de Oca facility, explicitly stated that “the allegations were studied carefully, but no positive results were found in any of the cases.” The Argentine Foreign Ministry also issued a statement that no evidence of organ trafficking had been produced. For example, “The Body Parts Business” states that at the Hospital Urgenica in Cordoba: A transplant coordinator who worked here for five years testified that electroencephalograms were performed on patients who had been given drugs that depressed signals from their central nervous systems. This passage appears to lend credence to the impression given by the program that a clandestine system had been organized in Argentina in which unsuspecting patients were killed so that their organs could be used for transplants. But after the program aired, Judge Luis Rueda, who had investigated the cases in Cordoba, challenged the interpretation of events in “The Body Parts Business” in an undated, unsourced article, received from the Pan- American Association of Eye Banks in Bogota, Colombia. It stated: Cordoba – Judge Luis Rueda rejected the information broadcast by the BBC that connects the local emergency hospital with a supposed network of organ trafficking in Argentina …. … the judge affirmed yesterday that his investigations revealed that there was no traffic in organs, at least up until the time that the death certificate was sent to the Supreme Court. … Rueda also said that abnormalities that could have occurred during the administration of an encephalogram are not of a “sensationalist” nature, as the BBC implied, and with respect to the use of drugs, he pointed out that “some patients arrive (accident victims brought to the emergency hospital) with drug overdoses, but this comes from street drugs, not from being drugged at the hospital. For this reason, the allegation of the television program is incorrect.” The final section of “The Body Parts Business” deals with Russia and uncritically cites a Russian police lieutenant who believes that people have been kidnapped for organ transplantation, although he admits that he has no evidence for this. The program does not mention that false rumors of child organ trafficking have been widespread in Russia since the Soviet disinformation campaign on this issue in 1987 and 1988, and fails to point out that organ trafficking claims need to be evaluated with this fact in mind. In sum, the most sensational revelations in “The Body Parts Business” turn out, on closer examination, to be mistakes or apparent fabrications. Like all other examinations of this issue, it contains no credible evidence of child organ trafficking. “ORGAN SNATCHERS”: A French television documentary “Organ Snatchers” (“Voleurs d’organes”), which also purported to show evidence of child organ trafficking, was also broadcast in late 1993. “Organ Snatchers” was produced by CAPA, and is narrated by Marie-Monique Robin. It has been shown in several countries and on February 4, 1994 was shown at the U.N. Center for Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, courtesy of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL). The IADL claimed that “the film presents irrefutable evidence” of “criminal trafficking of organs removed from destitute children.” This is not the case. “Organ Snatchers” also highlights the claim that patients at the Montes de Oca mental institution in Argentina had their corneas forcibly removed, in particular the allegation made about Pedro Reggi, which, as discussed above, has been retracted. A second section of the program deals with Colombia. The program includes a dramatic claim by a Colombian woman, Mrs. Luz Dary Vargas, that her young son, Weinis Jeison Cruz Vargas, had his corneas forcibly removed when she took him to a hospital to be treated for diarrhea and vomiting. The blind boy, misidentified as Jenson, was shown on the pages of “Life” magazine in October 1993, playing a flute, in a widely reproduced photograph. On February 4, 1994, the Colombian government’s Office of Human Rights issued a report on its investigation of this allegation. It stated that Jeison had gone blind due to natural causes. It reported that in early February 1983, when Jeison was four months old, he was hospitalized, suffering from a long list of maladies, including “severe bilateral eye infection (which) had produced perforations of the corneas, conjunctivitis, and drainage of purulent matter from each of his corneas.” The report further stated that “in one of the last evaluations given by the ophthalmology department of the hospital Lorencita Villegas de Santos, they said `that he had totally lost his vision.’” According to a December 1, 1993 letter from Dr. Luis Eduardo Salazar Oliveros, head of ophthalmology at the Lorencita Villegas de Santos Children’s Hospital, to Dr. Francisco Aldana Valdes, the assistant medical director of the same institution, an examination of Jeison’s medical records showed that he suffered from a “secondary bilateral ocular perforation and corneal ulcers, which were caused by an aeurigenous pseudonomy” and presented a “diagnosis of bilateral endophtalmitis.” Dr. Salazar added: “A patient with this diagnosis has the most negative prognosis possible in the field of ophthalmology because under these conditions the loss of vision is complete.” Jeison’s medical records show that the ophthalmology department of the hospital recorded, on February 23, 1983, that “there is a total loss of vision.” The February 4, 1994 Colombian government report also stated: The mother of the minor Weinis Jeison, Mrs. Luz Dary Vargas, received the sum of 40,000 (Colombian) pesos (about 60 U.S. dollars at the time) from the French journalist Marie-Monique Robin, for the version of the story that she gave regarding the child …. We note that the aforementioned journalist did not question the verbal testimony given by the humble peasant mother about the minor in question at any of the health institutions where the child was attended to. We maintain that they were not visited nor were the professional health officials who took care of the child or the medical records consulted either, as would have been hoped. The Colombian government report concluded: The work put forward by the French journalist Marie- Monique Robin in the investigation of alleged organ trafficking in this country and, in particular, regarding the case of Weinis Jeison Cruz Vargas, leaves much to be desired professionally because she did not present these presumed irregularities to the authorities, who had supposedly carried out these deeds, for clarification. With the false publication produced about this case, she has caused enormous damage in national and international public opinion with this kind of tendentious and obviously malintentioned story, which places into question the prestige and good name of Colombia. “Organ Snatchers” also inaccurately claims that a horrifying scandal uncovered in March 1992 in Barranquilla, Colombia provided evidence of organ trafficking for transplant. Press accounts of events in Barranquilla stated that indigents in Barranquilla were murdered and their bodies sold to the medical school to be used as cadavers for dissection by medical students. “Organ Snatchers” claims that the murders were undertaken for the purpose of trafficking in organs for transplants. The evidence indicates that this was not the case. The indigent who survived an attempt to murder him, escaped, and exposed this grisly scheme was named Oscar Rafael Hernandez. He reported that he was shot and then thrown on a pile of corpses and left for dead. After his assailants left the room, Oscar was able to flee. The circumstances of Oscar’s story make it clear that the people who attempted to murder him were not doing so in order to use his organs for transplant. Once a person dies and blood circulation ceases, the organs begin to deteriorate immediately and are useless for transplantation within minutes. If Oscar’s assailants had wished to murder him in order to use his organs in transplants, they would not have left him on a pile of corpses, but instead immediately have begun the effort to extract his organs surgically. A sterile hospital setting with trained medical personnel would have been necessary. None of this was in evidence. “Organ Snatchers” omits this essential aspect of the discussion. Whatever was at the root of the macabre scandal in Barranquilla, it was not organ trafficking for transplant. A third section of “Organ Snatchers” deals with Mexico. It quotes Hector Ramirez Cuellar, a member of the Mexican parliament, as stating that he knows of a child who was kidnapped, had his kidneys removed, and then was returned home with two thousand dollars. Mr. Ramirez’s story relates the child organ trafficking myth in a commonly repeated form: in order to partially atone for their sins, the alleged kidnappers return the child to his family with a generous amount of money. It is never explained why hard-hearted criminals who are ruthless enough to supposedly steal organs from innocent children would feel obliged to do this. Real life criminals do not engage in such inexplicable acts. But even though this aspect of the myth does not stand up to rational scrutiny, it is often repeated, perhaps because it adds poignancy to the story. As the April 18, 1994 issue of “Time” magazine stated, in recounting the false rumors that led to the attack on U.S. citizen June Weinstock: The word-of-mouth allegations spread rapidly throughout Guatemala: gringos are snatching babies and ripping out their vital organs for sale abroad. Eight babies, the whispers assured, were found with their stomachs slashed open. One had a $100 bill stuck in its abdomen, plus a note that said in English, “Thanks for your cooperation.” There was no evidence that such gruesome trade exists. But an anti-foreigner paranoia took root swiftly and with savage results. Claims of a compensatory cash payment also conveniently provide a supposed reason why no one has ever come forward with evidence of such an alleged crime. “Organ Snatchers” also includes an interview with a person claiming to be a police investigator in Mexico, who refuses to give his name because “to talk with someone means that you risk your own life.” This allegation highlights another element of the child organ trafficking myth: that it is supposedly organized by a shadowy “organ mafia” so powerful and omnipresent that it can destroy anyone who tries to reveal its clandestine operations. In classic conspiracy theory style, the purported existence of this “organ mafia” is commonly offered as an explanation of why no evidence of child organ trafficking has ever been produced: supposedly because those who are knowledgeable about this scheme are afraid to speak out publicly because they if they did so they would be killed. If this logic were solid, then the world would not know about the existence of the drug cartels or the professional criminal organizations in various countries. Many courageous journalists, government officials, policemen, judges, and others have openly challenged the drug cartels and other organized criminal organizations and brought some of their members to justice. If these powerful groups of professional criminals, with their enormous financial resources and many hired killers, have been unable to prevent the exposure and disruption of many of their operations, then the alleged “organ mafia” would logically have to be many times more powerful and efficient than all known criminal organizations in order to have been able to successfully suppress all information about its existence. There is no evidence that any such “organ mafia” exists. Instead, the less dramatic truth is that the alleged victims of organ theft do not come forward for the simple reason that their stories are not real. As “Organ Snatchers” itself stated, “It turned out to be impossible to meet any of the victims in Mexico. Every time the television crew found a lead, the families refused to talk.” One small section of “Organ Snatchers” deals with organ transplantation in the United States. The only person interviewed is Janice Raymond, who is not a physician but a professor of women’s studies and medical ethics at the University of Massachusetts. Professor Raymond suggests that “it’s very likely that there is some cover-up going on someplace” with regard to organ transplantation in the United States. She admits that she has “no proof” that clandestine organ transplants are occurring, but suggests that “private clinics” may be receiving organs from abroad and using them in clandestine, illegal transplants. As evidence, she states that although there are only about 4,000 organ donors in the United States each year, far more than 4,000 organ transplants are performed each year. She speculates that this discrepancy may exist because: “I think it’s possible to be receiving organs from abroad and for those organs not to be accounted for in the National Registry (the list maintained by the U.S. organization responsible for matching organ donors to organ recipients).” Ms. Raymond’s speculation ignores the fact that, in the United States, frequently more than one organ is used from each deceased organ donor; several organs can be used for transplantations involving different recipients. Therefore, there are always more organ recipients than organ donors and there is no reason to postulate the existence of a clandestine organ trafficking network. Any transplant physician, transplant surgeon, or person familiar with organ transplant procedures could have explained this fact to the makers of “Organ Snatchers.” But, unfortunately, no people knowledgeable about organ transplantation in the United States were included in the program. In sum, the judgement of the Colombian government that the treatment of the issues in “Organ Snatchers” is “tendentious and obviously malintentioned” seems justifiable. The program gives prominence to the flimsiest, most insupportable allegations of clandestine organ and tissue trafficking, while other facts are totally ignored. In this connection, it is worth noting that Colombia’s Barraquer Institute of America, which is world renowned for its ophthalmological expertise, has sued the makers of “Organ Snatchers” for libel. In the summer of 1994, more than six months after “Organ Snatchers” first aired, its narrator Marie- Monique Robin wrote a three-part series of feature articles that was offered for sale to magazines in various countries by the GLMR agency in France. Articles by Ms. Robin subsequently appeared in the July 7 and July 14 issues of the Turkish magazine “Aktuel” and in the November issue of the Spanish edition of the French magazine “Marie Claire.” The articles, entitled “The Organ Thieves,” accompanied by 40 photographs, contained much of the same material that had been in the “Organ Snatchers” television program. Despite the fact that she was writing in mid-1994, Ms. Robin continued to publicize the original claims made in her program about Pedro Reggi and Jeison. Mr. Reggi’s claim had been repudiated and disproved in November 1993 and Jeison’s claim had been decisively discredited by February 1994. The print articles also included distortions and inaccuracies that were not present in the television program. For example, in discussing the case of Jeison, Ms. Robin wrote that Jeison’s mother took him to a hospital “when he was eight,” at which time his corneas were allegedly removed. Ms. Robin then wrote, “a child’s eyeball is fully developed when it is seven years old. An adult can therefore receive a child’s cornea. One that is less than seven years old is simply `of inferior quality.’” Thus, according to Ms. Robin, Jeison’s eyes were suitable for transplants into anyone his age or older. However, as Jeison’s medical records show, he was admitted to the hospital when he was four months of age, not eight years old, and lost his eyesight just before he turned five months old. Either Ms. Robin’s research was so shoddy that she was not even able to determine Jeison’s age at the time of his hospitalization correctly, or else she deliberately misrepresented his age in order to make the tale of alleged cornea theft seem more plausible. THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION: On September 14, 1993, the European Parliament adopted a “Resolution on Prohibiting Trade in Transplant Organs.” Two of its preambular clauses stated: whereas there is evidence that foetuses, children and adults in some developing countries have been mutilated and others murdered with the aim of obtaining transplant organs for export to rich countries, (and) …having regard to the current existence of trafficking in foetuses, children and incapable adults who are used as organ providers, the resolution then stated that it: calls for action to be taken to put a stop to the mutilation and murder of foetuses, children and adults in certain developing countries for the purpose of providing transplant organs. The resolution was based on a February 25, 1993 “Report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on prohibiting trade in transplant organs.” The rapporteur for the report was Mr. Leon Schwartzenberg, a Europarliamentarian who had formerly served as Minister of Health in France. Following a sensitive, nuanced, and informative discussion of the medical, ethical, and social factors involved in the transplant organ shortage, the report unfortunately went on to give credence to the organ trafficking rumors, stating: Organized trafficking in organs exists in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs, and is often controlled by the same people. This traffic is all the more monstrous where it involved killing people to remove organs which can be sold at a profit. To deny the existence of such trafficking is comparable to denying the existence of the ovens and gas chambers during the last war. In the September 16, 1994 issue of Italy’s “La Stampa,” Mr. Schwartzenberg cited an article by Maite Pinero in the August 1992 issue of “Le Monde Diplomatique” as the main source of his information on the child organ trafficking rumors. Mr. Schwartzenberg apparently had not realized that this article was full of inaccuracies. For example, the Pinero article stated that: In January 1987, … Mr. Leonardo Villeda Bermudez, Secretary of the National Committee for Social Welfare (in Honduras) disclosed that children were being used as “organ donors.” … In an interview with the newspaper “La Tribuna” and on Radio America, Mr. Leonardo Villeda gave details of the inquiry. He concluded as follows: “We have proof that children bought or stolen from poor families were sold to networks in the United States for a minimum of 10,000 dollars to be used as organ donors.” What the Pinero article failed to add, however, was that, as explained previously, Mr. Villeda had immediately repudiated these claims. In an interview with the Honduran newspaper “El Heraldo” on January 3, 1987, he explained “that he was not used to giving interviews to the press and that he confused a simple `rumor’ when trying to promote several ideas regarding the adoption of babies.” On January 8, the top officials of the Honduran Committee for Social Welfare categorically denied that any trafficking in infants for organ transplants had ever occurred. The First Lady of Honduras and Honorary President of the Committee, Miriam de Azcona, emphatically stated that “the Committee has no documents that indicate anything of this sort has happened in the past.” The President of the Committee said, “I have never heard of anything like this during my service in the Committee.” Sergio Sanchez, the Committee’s Special Counsel, stated that “It was impossible that Honduran children adopted by foreign couples are being used for transplants.” The Pinero article, written five and one-half years after the events in question, mentioned none of these repudiations of the original Villeda allegations. The Pinero article also stated that in Guatemala in February 1987: Mr. Baudillo Hichos Lopez, head of the police information services, declared: “We know that the children sent to the United States under the pretext of being adopted were in fact used as organ donors.” Mr. Hichos Lopez was actually head of the intelligence and narcotics section of the Guatemalan Treasury Police. After the allegations attributed to him had spread, Mr. Hichos Lopez denied that he had made such claims, stating in an October 28, 1987 letter to the U.S. Public Affairs Officer in Guatemala: I have the pleasure to write to you in order to respond to your note … by means of which you brought to my attention articles appearing in a foreign weekly and a foreign periodical concerning the traffic in children to the United States for illicit purposes. On this matter, I wish to inform you that … at no time did I make the scandalous and compromising statements of the kind you cited. In addition, the child organ trafficking allegations had been strongly denied by the Guatemalan authorities. In the February 18, 1987 issue of “Prensa Libre,” Guatemalan Minister of the Interior Juan Jose Rodil characterized as “a piece of very imaginative fiction the story that infants are clandestinely sent to the United States to be used as organ transplant donors for American children.” On March 15, 1987, “El Grafico” published a letter from the U.S. embassy’s public affairs officer, John Treacy, in which he stated: I visited the head of the director of the Treasury Police, General Echeverria, to ask about this story. General Echeverria told me that he and his men had “no” information or evidence – he used the Spanish word “indicios” – that the children were to be used for this purpose. He said neither he nor the Treasury Police spokesman had made the organ transplant charge and speculated that its source may have been a lower ranking employee repeating “rumors.” The Pinero article mentioned only the original allegations as they had been inaccurately reported by the press in Guatemala, and ignored all of the subsequent clarifications, repudiations, or denials – the same way that it had reported events in Honduras. The Pinero article also claimed: In four years, 4,000 Brazilian children with visas had arrived in Italy to be adopted. One thousand were actually found again. There is no trace of the 3,000 others. In fact, curiously, many requests for adoption came from Campanie, a region of large families and also a region where the Camorra reigns. Two Italian judges, Mr. Angelo Gargani and Cesar Martinello went to Brazil, to Salvador-de- Bahia. On their return to Italy, they informed the government that in their opinion, the Camorra had set up “a traffic in children’s organs.” The myth of the “missing 3,000” Brazilian children that Pinero cited may have been started by Mr. Paul Barruel, a professor of theology at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. A July 31, 1991 story published by EFE, the Spanish news service, cited Mr. Barruel: “Between 1984 and 1990, Brazilian police issued 9,135 passports for as many children supposedly adopted abroad. Four thousand of these were sent to Italy, but Italian authorities claim to have registered only one thousand arrivals.” … Paul Barruel, a member of the Brazilian commission investigating the destination of these children, alleged that they were used as donors of organs and holds responsible the “Italian Camorra because they have the necessary structure to preserve and transport organs.” … And he added further, “everybody has to know that the U.S. accepts the kidneys and livers of innocent children, that Europe beats thanks to the heart of an innocent and that Japan can see with the eyes of horror and misery.” When these allegations arose, the U.S. embassy in Rome contacted adoption officials at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Justice. Although complete records for all years between 1984 and 1990 were not available, the Italian government stated the number of children recorded as having been adopted from Brazil from 1986 to 1989 was 2,869, broken down as follows: 1986 – 507 adoptions 1987 – 626 adoptions 1988 – 786 adoptions 1989 – 950 adoptions Extrapolating from the 1986-1989 figures, probably several hundred additional adoptions occurred during the 1984-1985 period and, if the steady upward trend observed from 1986 to 1989 continued, there would have been more than 1,000 adoptions of Brazilian children in 1990. Adding this additional 1,300 or so adoptions to the 2,869 adopted between 1986 and 1989 makes the total figure for the period 1984 to 1990 more than 4,000. Therefore, there are no “missing 3,000” Brazilian children as Barruel and Pinero inaccurately claimed. The Pinero article also mentioned allegations made by Paraguayan judge Angel Campos in 1988 that were shown to be without foundation, false allegations surrounding the Montes de Oca mental institution in Argentina, and false claims regarding Colombia, which have been examined above. It also raised suspicions about possible child organ trafficking in Mexico. Ms. Pinero may not have been aware that shortly before her article had appeared, on July 20, 1992, the Mexican magazine “Epoca” had published the findings of its investigation of allegations of child organ trafficking in Mexico. It stated: Doctor Arturo Dib Kuri, director of the Health Secretariat’s National Transplants Register, expresses this opinion: “The possibilities of human organ and tissue trafficking are extremely remote. It would be virtually impossible to conceal a criminal organization of this magnitude.” The interviewee continues: “First, to obtain an idea of what we are saying, I need only mention that, in the entire country, there would be, at the most, 10 doctors capable of performing a transplant. In an operation of this type, such as a liver transplant, 32 persons participate in an operating room, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, and team and technical personnel; not to mention laboratory workers and the personnel required for post-operative hospitalization ….” Doctor Dib Kuri also describes the conditions for preserving an organ outside the body. The medical technique for extracting a kidney is very delicate. “It (the operation to remove the kidney) takes from 4 to 6 hours …. Once it (the kidney) is outside the donor’s body, it must be kept at a temperature no lower than 4 degrees centigrade, because the organ must retain optimal oxygenation levels.” “Organs such as the heart, lung, liver, and pancreas have, at the most, a duration of 6 hours after they are extracted from the human body; and this is under preservation conditions requiring advanced technology and an infrastructure that hardly any hospital could possess.” Dib Kuri comments: The number of persons engaged in a surgical practice of this type, and the complex hospital infrastructure that it requires, make it extremely difficult to keep this type of crime clandestine, in the event that anyone were to attempt to deal in organs.” “I can’t imagine one of those 10 doctors that we have in Mexico who are capable of making a transplant becoming involved with a criminal organization engaged in such activities. These are not operations that can be performed in any old hospital.” “The recipient would not risk receiving an organ from anyone. All this is a mere rumor. I don’t dare deny that there are stolen children, but it could be done for other purposes, such as prostitution; it is highly unlikely to be for the purpose of extracting and selling their organs.” The Pinero article also claimed that “in Peru, a total of 3,000 children were sent by U.S. lawyer Patrick Gagel to the United States and Italy in 30 months,” and pointedly asked “what has become of these children,” implying that they might have been used for organ transplants. The U.S. attorney James Patrick Gagel was, in fact, arrested in Peru in 1992 and charged with arranging thousands of illegal adoptions. Gagel, who came to Peru in 1989 on a Fulbright fellowship to help reform the Peruvian criminal justice system, had remained in Peru and started an international adoption service in 1990 with a Peruvian lawyer. According to an April 16, 1994 article in the “Los Angeles Times:” Gagel said the adoptions he handled were done in Peruvian provinces to avoid red tape and corruption in Lima. One of the papers required for an adoption was a police certificate to show that the baby was not a missing person. Gagel said Commander Victor Prado, former head of the police missing person bureau in Lima, charged $300 for each certificate, but Gagel refused to pay. It was the same Commander Prado who first accused Gagel and 22 Peruvians of operating a child- trafficking ring. The 22 included employees of Gagel’s office, his lawyer- partner, foster mothers who took care of babies to be adopted and people whose names were “found in my card file, people I didn’t even know,” Gagel said. Prado’s police raided Gagel’s home and office, confiscating papers and a computer. Prado himself arrested Gagel at 7:30 am in his apartment, beating him and screaming obscenities, according to Gagel. Gagel pressed charges against Prado for a series of violations, but those charges were dismissed. The charges against Gagel, however, resulted in indictments. The government attorney who brought the original charges said Gagel’s “ring” had arranged thousands of irregular adoptions. Gagel said he arranged no more than 40, all by the book (according to the rules). He said … he earned only a modest income from them. The Pinero article concluded by dramatically asserting: No one denies the existence of a dreadful clandestine market (in organs) anymore. Miserable populations in Third World countries are its victims. After gold, silver and precious stones, after oil, coffee, cotton, is the search for organs the modern version of the pillaging of the South by the North? The Pinero article used the simple technique of selectively repeating allegations without either subjecting them to critical examination or mentioning the many press accounts pointing to the fallacy of the accusations. The article gave great credence to charges of child organ trafficking made by various officials, but totally ignored or discounted the subsequent denials or repudiations of these charges. The most improbable claims were taken at face value, as if it were possible for a single U.S. attorney and his Peruvian partner to process 3,000 intercountry adoptions in a two-year period, which would mean completing the extensive paperwork necessary for 6 adoptions on each working day. Intercountry adoptions typically take weeks or months to process. Similarly, the article assumed that 75 percent of the numerous Brazilian infants arriving in Italy could vanish without anyone noticing this for years. In short, all objectivity was abandoned in the Pinero article. The article in “Le Monde Diplomatique” was one of many that Ms. Pinero had written giving credence to the child organ trafficking myth. She has written articles on this subject since April 14, 1987, when her first article, “To Sell the Hearts of Infants,” appeared in the French communist party newspaper “L’Humanite.” At the time, Ms. Pinero was the Central American correspondent for “L’Humanite,” based in Havana. She has written numerous articles on this subject in the years since, but none with the impact of her August 1992 article in “Le Monde Diplomatique.” THE “SOTTAS REPORT” In March 1994, Eric Sottas, director of the World Organization Against Torture, presented a 13-page paper on “Trade in organs and torture” at the Eurosciences Media Workshop. In this paper, described in media accounts as the “Sottas report,” Mr. Sottas expressed his belief that there was “increasing evidence emerging to support the allegations of the existence of a network involving the trafficking of human beings for organ transplants,” and discussed seven countries in which he believed that clandestine organ trafficking might be occurring. Sottas was also interviewed by the Mexican newspaper “Proceso” on this subject, and their article on his allegations was the basis for subsequent articles in other newspapers in Latin America, and for an article in the “Los Angeles Times.” This latter article stated that the “Sottas report” had listed six Latin American countries as “confirmed traffickers in child organs.” In fact, all of Sottas’ supposed evidence was hearsay; none of it was substantiated, and some of it had been repudiated before his paper had been written. The first country Sottas listed was Nepal. As evidence, he cited the addendum to the January 1994 report by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography entitled “Visit by the Special Rapporteur to Nepal” (E\/CN.4\/1994\/84\/Add. 1). This addendum states: During the Special Rapporteur’s visit, several sources, including the police, expressed concern on the issue (of the sale of children’s organs). They indicated that there was trafficking of children to India for the purpose of sale of organs. High ranking police sources informed the Special Rapporteur of a 1993 case concerning a child and an adolescent kidnapped from Nepal and taken into India. As reported, the kidnapper was from Bihar. The case concerned trafficking with the intention of extracting their kidneys. The young persons were saved as the result of cooperation between border authorities, and they were brought back to Nepal. No names or other specific details that would permit this allegation to be checked are mentioned in the Special Rapporteur’s account. The name of the alleged kidnapper is not mentioned; the names of the alleged victims are not mentioned; nor are the names of the “high ranking police sources.” Until specific information is provided that would allow this allegation to be checked for accuracy, it must remain another unsubstantiated allegation, one of many on this subject. As has been shown earlier, high ranking police sources in other countries have been known to have put forward unsubstantiated allegations of child organ trafficking. Their assertions can not be taken as ipso facto evidence that such activities are occurring. So far, no information that would substantiate the Nepalese allegation has been made public. In the absence of such evidence, there is no reason to conclude that it is anything more than another manifestation of the ubiquitous child organ trafficking rumor. The second country that Mr. Sottas mentioned was Brazil, where he repeated the allegation in the report presented to the European Parliament “that some 3,000 children adopted from Brazil had been sent to Europe as part of the market for organ transplants in Europe and Italy in particular.” The groundlessness of this allegation was discussed above. The third country that Mr. Sottas mentioned was Argentina, where he repeated the accusations that organ and tissue trafficking had occurred at the Montes de Oca mental institution, focusing particularly on the Pedro Reggi case. He was apparently not aware that it had been publicly repudiated four months earlier. The fourth country Mr. Sottas mentioned was Peru, where he repeated the false allegation that James Gagel, whom he misidentified as Patrick Gagel, might have been involved in trafficking in children’s organs. The unfounded nature of these charges has been discussed above. The fifth country Mr. Sottas mentioned was Colombia, where he mentioned the Barranquilla incident, which had nothing to do with organ transplants, and another case raised by Maite Pinero, the author of the long article in “Le Monde Diplomatique.” Mr. Sottas wrote: According to Maite Pinero, … two children were reportedly kidnapped and had their eyeballs removed. The first case was that of a little girl who was subsequently returned to her family. The second case was that of a young boy who was found dead by a peasant named Garrigo Mesa. According to the death certificate signed by a doctor at the regional hospital of Cundinamarca, the eyeballs of the victim had been removed. According to Maite Pinero, the family of the little girl and Mr. Garrigo Mesa subsequently disappeared following the publicity made around this case. The familiar pattern of evasions is evident: there is no specificity about the identity of the alleged victims; they are simply a “little girl” and a “young boy.” In addition, both the family of the little girl and the man who discovered the young boy are said to have disappeared without a trace. Thus, there is no evidence, only claims based on phantoms. The sixth country Mr. Sottas mentioned was Mexico. Mr. Sottas cited Mr. Hector Ramirez Cuellar, a parliamentarian who had declared that he was “convinced” that Mexican children have been abducted for use in organ transplants. Mr. Ramirez has not produced any evidence that would substantiate his beliefs, however. None is mentioned by Mr. Sottas and Mr. Ramirez mentioned none in his comments broadcast in the French television program “Organ Snatchers,” which was discussed earlier. The last country that Mr. Sottas mentioned was Honduras. He wrote: On 18 April 1993, the President of Honduras, Mr Rafael Callejas, publicly voiced his concern about the fears that a network for the traffic of children’s organs had been established in his country. On 23 April 1993, “Le Monde” published an article which included, amongst others, the declarations made by the Liberal Member of Parliament, Mr. Rosario Godoyon (actually, Ms. Rosario Godoy), who claimed that the body of a mutilated child had been discovered in the cold room of a lorry 175 km. from Tegucigalpa. This passage of Mr. Sottas’ report illustrates the danger in relying on accounts in the international media without checking with original sources in the country in question. Honduran president Rafael Callejas had, indeed, voiced fears that child organ trafficking had occurred in Honduras, a fact that had been widely reported in the international press. But what was not nearly as widely reported was that after investigating this issue, President Callejas and others concluded that such clandestine organ trafficking was impossible in Honduras for technical reasons and that there was no reason to believe that any such activities had ever occurred. Moreover, Honduran Congresswoman Rosario Godoy de Osejo never produced any evidence to substantiate her claim that a body of a mutilated child had been found, although her accusations created a media uproar. In the wake of her charges, the Honduran authorities quickly established that the child organ trafficking claims were groundless. On April 19, 1993, the President of the Honduran Supreme Court, Orlando Lozano Martinez, stated: “These allegations have been coming forward for three years and we have not been able to prove anything nor find merit in them through investigation.” On April 21, Honduran Attorney General Leonardo Matute Murillo stated that his office had investigated organ trafficking charges for more than one year and found nothing to support them. The spokesman for the Honduran police also stated that the police had investigated organ trafficking allegations and found them to be completely false. None of these clarifications received much attention in the international media, however. In a typical pattern, repeated numerous times, the original child organ trafficking allegations receive tremendous publicity, despite being unsubstantiated. The denials, repudiations, and clarifications that follow receive little or no attention outside of the country in which the incident allegedly took place. Thus, people worldwide hear about the inaccurate allegations, but people in only the country concerned learn about the denials. In this way, the child organ trafficking rumor gains undeserved credibility and is often repeated by prestigious organizations and individuals who rely on international media accounts but lack the time or resources to carry out the research necessary to check the allegations. In this way, child organ trafficking becomes “conventional wisdom” in the minds of many. Later in his paper, Mr. Sottas revealed a stunning ignorance of the most elementary facts about organ transplantation in the United States. He wrote: As far as the United States is concerned, only about one- fifth of the 20,000 or so organs transplanted every year are recorded in a National Register which enables close control. The many operations that are carried out by private clinics do not fall within this centralised scheme. What is all the more preoccupying is the fact that in the United States, a number of surgeons seem to accept the notion of the purchase of organs. This passage is incorrect. First, all the organ transplants that have been performed in the United States since October 1, 1987 have been recorded in the U.S. Scientific Registry on Transplantation – not one-fifth of them, as Mr. Sottas claimed. All U.S. transplant operations are closely monitored in a highly centralized system organized by the United Network for Organ Sharing, which coordinates all organ transplant allocation in the United States. Finally, Mr. Sottas’ claim that numerous U.S. surgeons “seem to accept the notion of the purchase of organs” ignores the fact that since the passage of the National Organ Transplant Act in 1984, the sale of organs for transplant in the United States has been outlawed, with stiff penalties for violation. In sum, the “Sottas report” is nothing more than a rehashing of the various claims that have circulated in the world media, none of which has ever produced any credible evidence that would substantiate the claims of child organ trafficking. “NINOS DE REPUESTO”: In May 1994, a full-length 200-page book giving credence to the child organ trafficking myth was published in Spain. It was entitled “Ninos de Repuesto” (“Spare-Parts Children”), and was written by Spanish journalist Jose Manuel Martin Medem, an editor who works for the international section of Spanish National Radio. Despite its length, “Ninos de Repuesto” breaks little new ground, consisting almost in toto of a repetition of the various allegations that appeared in the world press between 1988 and 1994. Mr. Martin does not appear to have checked these charges very carefully and, as a result, repeats many inaccurate claims. For example, on page 55, the book cites Wilfredo Guzman, spokesman for CEMEDIN, the Mexican Center for Children’s Rights, as stating in April 1993 that: In the United States, there are some 10,000 children waiting for organs in order to survive. Therefore, dozens of Mexican midwives, nurses, doctors, lawyers, judges, and even clerics participate as accomplices in the theft of children from whom organs are extracted at clandestine clinics on the U.S. border. The organs are transplanted to rich children right there. Guzman’s charges of child organ trafficking are unsubstantiated. In addition, his claim that 10,000 children were waiting for transplants in the United States in 1993 is wrong. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which coordinates and monitors organ transplant allocation in the United States, keeps detailed national lists of all people in the United States who need organ transplants. According to UNOS records, there are 488 American children between the age of zero and five years of age on waiting lists for organ transplants. There are 265 children between the ages of six and ten who need transplants, and 698 older children and adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17. The total of these three figures is 1,451, far less than the 10,000 claimed by Mr. Guzman. Mr. Martin apparently did not check Mr. Guzman’s figures. On pages 91 and 92, Mr. Martin cites the August 1992 article by Maite Pinero in “Le Monde Diplomatique,” quoting the original allegations of child organ trafficking that first surfaced in Honduras in January 1987. Like the article in “Le Monde Diplomatique,” “Ninos de Repuesto” mentions only the allegations made by Leonardo Villeda Bermudez, former head of the Honduran Social Welfare Ministry, and fails to note that he immediately repudiated these allegations. On page 134, the book mentions the mistaken claim by Professor Paul Barruel of Sao Paulo, Brazil that only 1,000 of the 4,000 Brazilian children adopted by Italians between 1984 and 1990 were recorded as entering the country, and his belief that the Italian “Camorra” used the allegedly missing children for organ transplants. This groundlessness of this claim was discussed earlier. On page 155, the book repeats the mistaken claims made in “Le Monde Diplomatique” about American lawyer “Patrick Gagel.” The author apparently conducted no independent research on the case, and did not list James Gagel’s name correctly. On page 184, the book quotes the International Association of Democratic Lawyers: It is becoming increasingly difficult to procure reliable information on the organ traffic, especially when it affects children, owing to that traffic’s link with criminal organizations. Official investigations are being conducted in nearly all the Latin American countries, but no judicial proceedings are being initiated, because the witnesses and evidence disappear quickly. … The victims of this abominable traffic are kidnapped. Those later found still alive are usually under the effects of strong drugs that prevent them from remembering what has happened. Generally, their names are unknown, because the victims and their families fear the revenge of the traffickers. This assertion by the IADL is a masterpiece of obfuscation. It cites no specifics for its sweeping claims, conveniently claiming that the lack of any evidence for child organ trafficking is due to supposed fear of reprisals and alleged drugging of the presumed victims. Despite the fact that the IADL had no evidence for its assertions, its claims were treated seriously by Mr. Martin. It is worth examining the role the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has played in spreading the child organ trafficking rumor in more detail. The IADL is a non-governmental organization that has consultative status with the United Nations. It has been active in the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, established by the Sub- Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Several years ago, the IADL brought allegations of child organ trafficking that had supposedly occurred in Colombia to the attention of the Working Group. The government of Colombia subsequently investigated the allegations. The conclusions of their investigation were included in a February 7, 1991 letter written by Ambassador Eduardo Mestre Sarmiento, Permanent Representative of Colombia, to Mr. Jan Martenson, Under-Secretary General of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. In the letter, Ambassador Mestre stated: Respectfully, I am writing to you to inform you of the results of the investigation conducted by the competent authorities of my country in connection with the alleged sale of children’s organs in Colombia …. …This dramatic charge was brought to the attention of the Colombian authorities and an investigation was immediately undertaken by the Office of the Attorney General of the nation. This Mission requested the cooperation of the organization making the accusation (the International Association of Democratic Lawyers) in order that they might put us in touch with the witness which they say they have and send evidence to clarify the acts under investigation. We received a video cassette made by a French journalist in which it is stated, with pictures, that this practice is common in Colombia and is engaged in with the connivance of the police authorities. The investigation was exhaustive and I wish to inform you, Sir, that the acts referred to in the accusation by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers are completely unsubstantiated and that this organization has made use of evidence which, according to the results of the investigation, corresponds to a video montage in which it was found that: (1) The newspapers referred to as having published the news item never had any knowledge of these acts; (2) The place referred to as the child’s residence is not situated in the sector mentioned; (3) It was not possible to find the witness who signed the letter appended to the statement by the non- governmental organization making the accusation. The falsity of the accusations and the use of unfounded evidence place us in a delicate position which must be analyzed rigorously and objectively. What is involved is the sense of responsibility with which certain non- governmental organizations handle the information they receive from countries, especially when it leads to accusations concerning specific cases. In the case which I am submitting for your consideration, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has used unfounded evidence which affects the dignity of my Government and its police authorities. We cannot overlook this fact and accordingly, Sir, with my Government’s due respect and consideration for the United Nations, I would request you to take the necessary measures to ensure that this type of action by certain non-governmental organizations does not recur in the future. As regards the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, my Government respectfully requests you to report this case to the Non-Governmental Organizations Committee in order that it may take the appropriate measures on the status of this organization vis-a-vis the United Nations, since we consider that its attitude shows a lack of respect towards a Member State and the United Nations as a whole. The IADL, which was identified decades ago as a Soviet-controlled international front organization, has spread false anti-American disinformation since at least the time of the Korean War, when they were the vehicle for spreading false charges about the alleged U.S use of “germ warfare.” In 1988, the IADL submitted two reports giving credence to child organ trafficking rumors to the United Nations. In a July 11, 1988 report, U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar warned that reports of such activities were “possibly fictitious” and added that there had been no “corroboration” of them. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, the IADL has continued to give credence to the child organ trafficking rumors, publicizing many false, discredited claims. “Ninos de Repuesto” mentions other discredited charges, such as those made about Pedro Reggi in Argentina and ones made by Paraguayan Judge Angel Campos in 1988, for which he admitted he had no evidence. Although the book gives credence to the false rumor of child organ trafficking, it does cite U.S. denials of these charges and statements made by authoritative spokesmen such as Rafael Matesanz, national coordinator for transplants of Spain’s National Organization for Transplants. In a February 22, 1993 report that Mr. Matesanz prepared for Spain’s Ministry of Health and Consumption, cited on page 203 of “Ninos de Repuesto,” he stated, “The alleged export of organs to rich countries is impracticable today, with the current means of preservation.” With regard to the European Parliament resolution on this issue, Mr. Matesanz stated: The reference to (rumors of child organ trafficking) in an official document controlled by the European Parliament is improper from any standpoint, because it implies acknowledgement that such practices exist. As a result, there is an additional deterioration in the image of transplants, and negative repercussions on the procurement of organs. Mr. Matesanz’s recommendation was that “our country should by no means sign any proposal including this type of assertion.” On balance, although “Ninos de Repuesto” includes some repudiations of false child organ trafficking claims, the general thrust of the book, unfortunately, gives the rumors credence. For example, the book’s final sentence asserts: The trafficking of children and the marketing of their organs are the most merciless businesses in the dungheap of the market economy, in which anyone who can pay obtains whatever he needs. The author states that his book was the culmination of six years of research. It is unfortunate that despite the many long hours that the author labored on the project he was not able to conduct sufficient research to learn that the claims he was repeating were contradicted by the facts and, in many cases, had been repudiated by the individuals making the claims. Despite its length, “Ninos de Repuesto,” like all other examinations of this issue, contains no credible evidence of child organ trafficking. THE “CORREIO BRAZILIENSE” SERIES: From July 24 to July 31, 1994, a series of articles on alleged child organ trafficking appeared in the Brazilian newspaper “Correio Braziliense.” The articles demonstrated the journalistic hazards involved in relying on secondary sources. Although the author of the articles, Ana Beatriz Magno, interviewed 101 people during her research, she did not consult any sources in Argentina or Colombia. Therefore, when she wrote about the Pedro Reggi and Jeison cases in those countries, her reports were badly out of date and inaccurate. In addition, the sources to whom she talked in Europe, who included three people who have been in the forefront of the effort to give credence to the child organ trafficking charges, French journalists Maite Pinero and Marie-Monique Robin and International Association of Democratic Lawyers Assistant Representative Renee Bridel, apparently did not tell Ms. Magno that the original allegations of cornea theft involving Pedro Reggi and Jeison had been discredited months earlier. Thus, the articles in “Correio Braziliense,” while they may have appeared reliable and authoritative to a Brazilian audience not familiar with these cases, suffered from a lack of even the most elementary fact checking. With regard to Pedro Reggi, the articles badly misreported even the simple matter of the dates of his residence in the Montes de Oca facility. A July 24 article claimed, with regard to Reggi: Dated September 1989, the admission record is categorical: all of the youth’s vital senses are in order. His vision was graded ten, and he did not even have to wear glasses. His problem was actually his head. A year later, on 10 October 1990, the psychiatrist, Florencio Sanchez, at that time director and “sheriff” of the hospital, changed his mind. He reached the conclusion that Pedro had a bilateral cataract. “He must be operated on immediately, at the Lagleyze Hospital in Buenos Aires,” stated Doctor Sanchez’s medical prescription. The hospital still has Argentina’s only public eye bank today. The cataract was the signal. Pedro was targeted by the mafia headed by Sanchez that has infiltrated the Argentine public health system. The doctors removed Pedro’s corneas. He was insane, and was left blind. This is a powerful passage. But virtually nothing in it is true. Pedro Reggi was not admitted to the Montes De Oca facility in 1989. According to his half-brother Mario Barretto, speaking on the November 25, 1993 “Hora Clave” television program in Argentina, “he was admitted in 1981” to the Montes de Oca facility and remained there for “five years.” Thus, he was released in 1986. Therefore, Ms. Magno could not quote from documents that record him as being admitted there in 1989 and operated on in 1990. In addition, according to the Pedro Reggi’s medical records, which were summarized in a December 6, 1993 letter from Dr. Patricia Rey to the director of the Lagleyze Hospital in Buenos Aires, Reggi had surgery for “bilateral congenital cataracts” when he was nine months old (he was born in 1965) and surgery to improve his vision was contemplated in 1984 but it was decided not to pursue it in 1985 because “the anterior chamber was filled and the cornea was infiltrated.” In light of this, his vision could not have been flawless in 1989, as Ms. Magno claims. It is clear that Ms. Magno did not do sufficient research to discover that these claims she made about Reggi were insupportable, even with regard to the simplest, most easily verifiable facts. With regard to the claim that the director of the Montes de Oca facility, Florencio Sanchez, who died in jail while awaiting trial, was the head of a “mafia” and indulged in massive corruption, an article in the March 16, 1992 issue of the Argentine magazine “Somos” stated: In contrast to the probable illicit administrative dealings, totaling several million dollars, is Sanchez’s modest house, built at the turn of the century by personnel from the complex, and his 1975 model car. Apart from the garden, well tended and large, the house has suffered neglect for years. His wife is quoted in the article as stating: “We don’t have a peso, nor do we lead a life of luxury. We bought this house with a loan from the Mortgage Bank that we are still paying.” As is implied by this passage, someone who allegedly embezzled millions of dollars and headed a “mafia” would be unlikely to drive a 17-year old car and live in a modest, run-down house. The Magno series was also badly misinformed about the Jeison case in Colombia. It claimed that “the boy stopped seeing at the age of ten” because his corneas were removed against his will in an operation. But Jeison’s medical records, discussed in an earlier section, record him as having lost his sight from disease at the age of five months. The Colombian government report on this case was issued in February 1994 and discussed in the Colombian press in March 1994. If Ms. Magno had consulted Colombian sources during her research, she would have discovered that the allegations she repeated about Jeison had been discredited months earlier. One of the articles in the “Correio Braziliense” series included the stories of two Brazilian children, referred to anonymously as P. and D., who were allegedly kidnapped, both from the same shopping mall in Rio de Janiero, and returned to their parents with a kidney missing, in a story similar to the “kidney heist” urban legend in the United States. The manager of the shopping mall where the incidents allegedly occurred denied any knowledge of the alleged kidnappings, however. Dr. Jose Roberto Coelho de Rocha, the former president of the Brazilian Nephrology Society, also discounted the claims, particularly the case of one boy who was said to have been returned to his parents after only one day’s absence. Dr. Coelho de Rocha pointed out that the surgery alone would take four hours, involve 20 doctors, and have to occur at a major medical center. Such surgery could not be clandestinely arranged in the time frame alleged. The article also claimed that the boy’s family had moved three times since the alleged incident and no longer lived in Rio de Janiero, making it difficult to check the story. The family of the other alleged victim was not identified in any way. Thus, these allegations appear to follow the familiar pattern of making claims that are difficult or impossible to check. The Brazilian Department of Justice’s Council for the Defense of Human Rights stated that it would investigate the claims published in “Correio Braziliense.” At the same time, the national secretary for citizen’s rights and justice, Pedro Avellar, cautioned, according to the July 28 issue of “Correio Braziliense,” that: he had not seen in the reports published to date any concrete data on the trafficking of children for the purpose of using them for grafts and transplants. “I am still anxious for more data. The articles add nothing to the charge of organ trafficking. They are more objective regarding illicit adoptions,” (Avellar said). The Brazilian government’s investigation is continuing. But many such anonymous allegations of child organ trafficking have been put forward during the past eight years. So far, no one has ever produced any evidence to substantiate a single one of them. In the midst of the media furor unleashed by the “Correio Braziliense” articles, the Brazilian government released the results of a previous investigation of child organ trafficking charges, which it had undertaken after the claims in the 1993 European Parliament resolution had been reported in the Brazilian press. According to the July 26 issue of “Correio Braziliense,” Brazilian Minister of Justice Alexandre Dupeyrat reported that this “extensive investigation” discovered “no concrete evidence that could prove illicit, criminal activity.” In sum, the series of articles in “Corrieo Braziliense” does not include any evidence that substantiates allegations of child organ trafficking. The stories that were capable of being checked had been proven false months earlier, a fact of which the reporter was unaware. Even the simplest facts about these cases were reported inaccurately, raising serious questions about the quality of research in the articles. The Brazilian government stated that it had investigated earlier alleged cases of child organ trafficking in Brazil and found no evidence to substantiate them, and resolved to investigate the allegations raised by the latest articles as well. ALLEGED ORGAN TRAFFICKING IN THE PHILIPPINES: A story reported in August 1994 about events in the Philippines illustrates how misinformation may result if journalists rely exclusively upon international media stories as their sources and do not conduct follow-up investigations of media reports in the country in question. On August 24, 1994, both the Reuter and Kyodo wire services reported a sensational story from Manila: four surgeons who had performed the Philippines’ first double organ transplant in 1988 had been charged with murdering the organ donor, Arnelito Logmao, for his kidney and pancreas. Reuter reported: According to court documents, Logmao was admitted to a government hospital in Manila on March 1, 1988, after falling from a pedestrian overpass. He had apparently been drinking. The physician on duty found no head injuries but allowed him to spend the night in the hospital. The next day, one of the four doctors charged transferred Logmao to the government’s National Kidney Institute after his condition allegedly worsened. The court documents allege that while Logmao was still alive, doctors cross-matched his tissue with the recipients and later pronounced him clinically dead. “With intent to kill him in order to retrieve vital organs … for purposes of financial gain and glory, (the respondents) surgically cut out his two kidneys and pancreas without the knowledge, consent and authority of his mother, thereby causing his untimely death,” (special prosecutor) Apostol said in his report. The Reuter account did note that “the four doctors denied the accusations and said Logmao was brain dead before the procedure began,” but the bulk of the story and the attention-grabbing headline featured the accusation of murder for organ transplant. After these initial accusations, more facts about the case began to appear in the media in the Philippines. On August 27, “The Manila Times” reported that in 1989 a Quezon City prosecutor had dismissed a murder complaint against the doctors in the Logmao case, a fact that the initial press accounts did not note. On September 8, several Philippine newspapers reported that the four doctors charged in the case had filed a 16-page supplemental motion to dismiss the case in which they noted that the alleged murder victim had been pronounced “brain dead” by Dr. Abdias Aquino, the neurology chief of the National Kidney Institute (NKI), and Dr. Antonio Rafael, the attending physician, before his organs had been transplanted, adding that these two doctors even went beyond generally accepted medical practices by ordering a second electroencephalogram to be performed before declaring Logmao to be brain dead. According to “The Philippine Star,” in response: Government prosecutors justified the filing of the murder charges by saying that a person, even if declared brain dead, is still, “for practical (sic) and in a layman’s point of view, alive.” On October 19, 1994, an article in the “Manila Bulletin” reported other arguments by the four accused doctors in a 47-page reply to the charges against them. The article stated: The physicians asserted that they acted in accordance with law and followed the guidelines governing organ retrieval and transplantation embodied in Republic Act No. 1056 in relation to Section 96 of the Presidential Decree No. 856. They maintained that: The person was declared brain dead by three competent and expert doctors several hours before actual harvest; there were no known relatives; and efforts were taken to locate the relatives. Besides, defense counsel said, the four doctors would not have performed the transplant operation without the go- signal of Dr. Filoteo Alano who, in his capacity as director of NKI, was authorized by law to give donor consent in the absence of the patient’s nearest relatives. They said that two doctors – both of whom were not part of the transplant team – pronounced Logmao “brain dead” at about 6:30 a.m. on March 3, 1988. At 3 p.m. on the same date, the kidneys and pancreas of Logmao were transplanted to one Lee Tan Koe and Alexis Ambustan. The lawyers said that the pronouncement that Logmao was “brain dead” came before the transplant operation and was made by Dr. Abdias Aquino, a consulting neurologist at NKI. He made the declaration after noting that the patient’s blood pressure drastically dropped, spontaneous respiration was gone, and he no longer responded to various tests and stimuli. These indications, according to Dr. Aquino, conclusively point to a “complete and irretrievable” loss of Logmao’s brain stem functions, meaning he was “brain dead.” Two electroencephalogram (EEG) tests confirmed this fact, Dr. Aquino further said. None of the Philippine press reports containing these additional facts was reported by any wire service. Thus, all that readers outside the Philippines would know was contained in the initial press accounts, which gave no details of the accused doctors’ side of the story. It is this natural tendency of the media to report sensationalistic charges and to ignore subsequent clarifications, denials or repudiations that has led to the circulation of much misinformation and half-truths with regard to charges of child organ trafficking and other alleged organ trafficking abuses. (Addendum to report: On December 28, 1994, a Philippine court dismissed the charges against the doctors, ruling that evidence indicated that Logmao was already “brain dead” when his organs were removed.) MISINFORMATION IN ITALY: In September 1994, allegations of child organ trafficking appeared in Italy, and spread to Germany, Turkey, and Brazil. The sequence of events demonstrates how vague allusions or hypothetical statements can be mistakenly reported as confirmed fact. On September 21, Italian Minister for the Family Antonio Guidi testified before the Italian Chamber of Deputies’ Social Affairs Committee. During his testimony, Guidi stated that he “did not exclude” the existence of “an illegal traffic in children for `health’ purposes … of which we are about to open an investigation.” Asked by a committee member to be more specific, Guidi stated: “Let’s wonder about illegal adoption in Italy of children who, instead of going to the families requesting them, end up elsewhere.” In an interview with the press after his statement, Guidi said he had been referring to illegal adoptions, not allegations of organ trafficking. Nevertheless, he added, he could not rule out the possibility that children might be transited through Italy to be used for organ transplants in other countries. These remarks led to a media furor. On September 22, the Italian newspaper “L’Informazione” reported Guidi as stating that “weak control of the borders and the heavy influx of children may have allowed abuses and even illegal organ trafficking.” This possibility was quickly refuted by Italian Minister of Health Raffaele Costa, who was quoted by “L’Informazione” and other Italian newspapers as stating: In Italy, transplants occur only in highly specialized, public clinics, and it is inconceivable that they would accept organs under the table. No surgeon, no medical team would ever engage in such criminal activity, for moral and professional reasons, nor on practical grounds, for it would not be possible to conceal these activities and they would be immediately discovered. On September 22, the Italian newspaper “L’Indipendente” reported the comment by Giuseppe Calderoli, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies’ Social Affairs Committee, that Guidi’s remarks before the committee had been “misunderstood” and that Guidi had “immediately clarified that the situation of illegal adoptions of children to which he had referred did not have to do with organ trafficking.” Nevertheless, the story spread, and became even more distorted when reported by a German reporter in Rome. On September 23, two German newspapers, the tabloid “Bild” and the more conservative “Die Welt,” carried stories on the Guidi allegations by the same reporter, Andreas Englisch. “Bild” ran the story on its front page, under a banner headline that read, “Organ Mafia – 3,000 Children Slaughtered – Minister Confirms Awful Suspicion.” The “Bild” story stated: A suspicion so awful that nobody wanted to believe it, but one that has now for the first time been officially confirmed by Italian Health (sic) Minister Antonio Guidi. For years, the mafia has been adopting children from Third World countries and having them smuggled into secret clinics in Italy, where they are killed and their organs removed. Innocent children to supply livers, kidneys, and hearts for the sick rich. In Brazil alone, Interpol is searching for 3,000 lost children. The story continued: His face as white as a sheet, Italian Health (sic) Minister Antonio Guidi stood before the Social Affairs Committee of the Italian parliament on Wednesday evening. “The suspicion is unfortunately no horror story, it is the truth. That is why I see no other option but to open an official investigation.” The awful trade in children as living organ donors. The article in “Die Welt” stated: It is reported that handicapped children between 8 and 12 years of age are being adopted in Third World countries and brought to secret clinics where they are killed and their organs removed. In the past, this suspicion was nothing more than an awful plot for some horror story. In a sensational statement before the Social Affairs Committee of the House of Deputies, Health (sic) Minister Antonio Guidi said: “The suspicion is unfortunately no horror story, it is the truth. That is why I see no other option but to open an official investigation.” Guidi also pointed out that Interpol was searching for 3,000 children who had disappeared in Brazil after being approved for adoption. … Minister Guidi: “We believe that the mafia smuggles the children into Italy, from where they are dispatched to their ultimate destination.” The stories by Englisch mistakenly identified Guidi as the Minister of Health, ignored the statements by the actual Italian Minister of Health Raffaele Costa that clandestine organ transplants were impossible in Italy, attributed a number of direct quotations to Guidi that had not been reported in the Italian press, ignored the comment by the head of the Social Affairs Committee that Guidi had been “misunderstood” and had “immediately clarified” that his statements regarding illegal adoption had nothing to do with organ trafficking, and, worst of all, reported Guidi’s hypothetical musings as officially “confirmed” fact. In addition, “Bild’s” imaginative headline writer decided that the story’s claim that Interpol was “looking for” 3,000 missing Brazilian children should be changed to “3,000 Children Slaughtered – Minister Confirms.” As has been discussed previously, the claim that 3,000 Brazilian children are missing is false. These stories in the German press became the basis for further stories on September 24 and 25 in the Turkish newspapers “Turkiye” and “Sabah.” In “Sabah,” Guidi’s alleged statements became even more seemingly specific and detailed. According to “Sabah,” Guidi stated: These adopted children are brought to Italy. Here they are brutally murdered and their internal organs are sold for astronomical prices all over the world. My words may sound like a horror story, but unfortunately they are true. An official investigation has been opened in order to capture these inhumane criminals. We are cooperating with international organizations and Western police. Thus, as the story was reported at greater and greater remove, the alleged statements by Minister Guidi grew in scope until it appeared as if he was unambiguously confirming the existence of child organ trafficking in Italy. In Brazil, Guidi’s allegations were reported more objectively. On September 23, the Brazilian newspaper “O Estado de Sao Paulo” carried a story that talked about the “supposed” existence of child organ trafficking alleged by Guidi and noted that “Italian authorities reacted indignantly to the denunciation, which they characterized as `absolutely unfounded’.” The remarks of Health Minister Costa denying the allegations were also reported. On the same day, the Brazilian newspaper “Jornal da Tarde” reported the important fact that Guidi possessed no evidence of child organ trafficking, in Italy or anywhere else. The article stated, “Minister Guidi denied he has evidence of concrete information on trafficking of organs, but assured that adopted children enter the country clandestinely.” A sidebar article in “Jornal da Tarde” noted that after allegations of child organ trafficking made by European Parliamentarian Leon Schwartzenberg had been reported in Brazil, that “the adoption system became much more rigid.” The article reported, with regard to adoptions in the Pernambuco area of Brazil: The result, following the creation of the State Judiciary Commission on Adoption, was a fall by 90 percent of adoptions made (36) in the first semester of this year, in relation to the same period last year, when more than 300 children were adopted. Italian Health Minister Costa also warned of the adverse effects that the child organ trafficking allegations could have on voluntary organ donations. In the September 24 issue of the Italian newspaper “L’Unita,” he was reported as stating: Minister Guidi’s alarmist tone is not justified. I regret as a person that these conjectures can be exploited. … the activity of surgeons, researchers, immunologists, scholars, the sacrifice of donors and the efforts at building civic awareness could be undermined by vague insinuations. THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONCEALING CLANDESTINE ORGAN TRANSPLANTS: Health and organ transplant officials in the United States and other countries have stated emphatically that it would be impossible to successfully conceal any clandestine organ trafficking ring. In many countries, the sale or purchase of organs for transplants is expressly forbidden by law, with stiff penalties for violators. For example, organ sales for transplant have been illegal in the United States since 1984. In 1994, the sale or purchase of organs for transplant was outlawed in India, where previously many voluntary organ sales by adults had taken place, in which they had sold one of their kidneys, often to a foreigner. In addition to the legal and moral deterrents to organ trafficking, the technical requirements that would be involved in arranging and operating an alleged murder-for-organ-transplantation scheme are so formidable that such clandestine activities are a practical impossibility. In order for an organ transplantation to have any chance of success, a number of sophisticated medical procedures must be conducted to determine the suitability of various organs for transplantation and to permit a match with potential recipients. In particular, correct tissue and blood typing is critical to matching donor organs and potential transplant recipients. Crossing the blood group barrier from transplant donor to recipient can result in death. An equally important consideration is histocompatibility, which measures the extent to which a donor organ and a recipient match. The surface of all cells in the body carries proteins known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. These proteins act as signals that identify what is uniquely self to our immune system. The importance of matching MHC antigens for transplanted organs is similar to the need to match blood types for blood transfusions. However, MHC matches are more complex, and excessive differences between a donor and a recipient will cause the recipient’s immune system to attack and reject the transplanted organ. In humans, the MHC antigens are encoded by a set of linked genes, which are designated as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). In transplantation, it is vital to the survival and well-being of the recipient to identify and match the donor’s HLA types. This can only be accomplished in a laboratory designed to test histocompatibility, and requires individuals with specialized laboratory skills to conduct the testing. After the organs have been extracted from a donor, an extremely delicate procedure that involves a transplant surgeon and support staff including an anesthesiologist, attending surgeons, and operating room nurses, the organs must be transported as rapidly as possible, typically by helicopter or airplane, to the hospitals where the transplants will occur. Before transporting the donor organ, special preservation solutions must be infused into it. Proper insulation and temperature controlled packaging including adequate ice or refrigeration must be used to protect the organ during shipment. Absolute sterile conditions must be maintained for the organ to remain viable for transplant. Organ transplants must be accomplished extremely rapidly because the time that organs can survive outside the body is severely limited. Hearts must be transplanted within 5 hours, livers within 24 hours, pancreases within 6 to 12 hours, and lungs within 5 hours. Kidneys can survive the longest, but most surgeons will not transplant a kidney that was removed more than 48 hours ago. Sophisticated surgical equipment and highly skilled medical personnel are necessary for a transplant to take place. At a minimum, one needs 20 individuals, including three members of a surgical team, one scrub nurse, one circulating nurse, one anesthesiologist, one perfusion technician, and one general function technician. For all transplant surgery, a large area is needed for the operating table, instrument table, laboratory instruments, anesthesia equipment, monitoring equipment, spare supplies, gas sources, and personnel access. In addition, in order to prepare for a kidney recipient’s surgery, a kidney machine must be available to perform dialysis. For a heart transplant, the patient must be placed on circulatory and respiratory bypass equipment during the entire length of the transplant procedure and constantly monitored by a pulmonary technologist. During a liver transplant, bleeding is extensive because the liver produces the substance that causes blood to coagulate. Access to a blood bank is necessary because as many as 20 to 50 units of blood may be required for blood transfusions. Thus, the daunting technical requirements of the transplant process make it impossible that transplants could occur clandestinely, as the child organ trafficking rumor alleges. Such highly complex operations could not occur at hidden, makeshift facilities. It would not be possible to assemble a team of highly trained medical professionals who would all be willing to engage in such morally repugnant criminal acts and be willing to take the enormous personal risks that would be involved in performing a transplant operation clandestinely. Nor would it be possible to arrange such a procedure for purely logistical reasons alone because the technical resources required could not be assembled outside of major medical centers. In addition, the transplant process does not end with the completion of the transplant operation. Follow-up care of the transplant recipient is critical for short-term and long-term survival and well- being. After the transplant operation, the organ recipient must be treated by a transplant physician, a separate individual, who monitors, medicates, and treats the transplant recipient for the rest of his life. No transplant physician would treat a person without knowing all the circumstances of their progressive organ disease, the details of their transplant operation, including the identity and health records of the donor of the organ, and a great deal of other information that would not be available if the transplant operation were performed clandestinely. It is important to remember that transplant surgeons and physicians are highly trained professionals who are handsomely compensated for their expertise. There would be no reason for them to engage in clandestine, illegal transplantations. On the contrary, they would have every incentive not to participate in such activities. If such illegal activities were detected – and they surely would be given the large number of people involved, the highly technical nature of the procedures, and the abhorrent nature of the alleged activities – this would mean the effective end of the surgeon or physician’s career, with catastrophic financial and personal implications. In sum, organ transplantation is such an immensely complicated, highly technical, heavily regulated, extremely time-sensitive procedure, involving so many highly trained professional personnel and so much sophisticated medical equipment, that clandestine organ trafficking is, quite simply, an impossibility from a practical point of view. The charges that children are being kidnapped and murdered for such purposes make the allegations even more dubious. Nor is there any evidence that any clandestine rings exist for the purpose of kidnapping children in order to extract their corneas for transplant. The requirements for a successful corneal transplant differ substantially from those for organs. Corneas, which are tissues, not organs, can be extracted up to 12 hours after death for use in sight-restoring transplantations (up to 18 hours given extremely favorable conditions). They can be preserved in a solution for up to two weeks, but are typically transplanted within five or six days. There is a shortage of corneas for transplantation in most parts of the world, but not in the United States and in some other industrialized countries. For example, in the United States, where corneal donations are organized by eye banks, 42,469 corneal transplants were performed in 1993. In addition, 5,042 corneas were exported from the United States for use in transplants in other countries. Of these, 789 went to Europe and Canada. The remaining 4,253 were sent to Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Of these, 2,998, or 70 percent, were placed without charge. Of the 2,689 corneas sent to Latin America, 2,457, or more than 90 percent, were provided free of charge. Thus, the insinuation in “The Body Parts Business” that “after gold, diamonds, and natural resources, are human body parts to become the next commodity to be extracted from the Third World?” has its facts inverted. In reality, much of the flow of human tissue for transplant goes from the United States to the Third World, and the majority of it is provided gratis. Allegations of child kidnapping for tissue transplants are essentially indistinguishable in the popular mind from the child organ trafficking urban legend. Most people do not understand the important differences between corneas and organs, even though the transplant procedures for them differ significantly as does the supply\/demand situation in some countries. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILD ORGAN TRAFFICKING ALLEGATIONS: In addition to the investigations of child organ trafficking allegations mentioned previously, in early 1987, when it was first alleged that Americans were adopting children for the purpose of organ transplantation, the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service all investigated their records and stated that they found no evidence of alleged organ trafficking. On July 23, 1987, in response to a European Parliament resolution asking for an investigation of such charges, the European Community Commission stated that it “does not know of any transplant operations performed in Europe for which the organs of Latin American children have been used.” On October 7, 1987, the Geneva-based non-governmental organization Defense for Children, International (DCI) stated, “In recent months, DCI has tried to have these reports verified by its representatives in Central America. So far, these investigations have failed to find any evidence to substantiate the reports.” On August 23, 1988, Mr. Gene Pierce, Executive Director of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in the United States, stated that, “since the establishment of the Scientific Registry on October 1, 1987, UNOS has kept very detailed records on organ donors. There has been no documentation of any Latin American children under the age of five becoming donors in the United States.” On August 25, 1988, Ms. Linda Sheaffer, Director of the Division of Organ Transplantation at the U.S. Public Health Service, stated that such illegal transplants would be “not only impractical but impossible.” She pointed out that some organ transplants “take up to 14 hours, none of the procedures could occur without the complete cooperation and knowledge of the hospital staff,” and “any such large scale operation would not be kept secret.” On September 23, 1988, the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights released a “Mission Report” on their “Investigation on Possible Trafficking in Infant Organs.” It stated, “we have not been able to find a single piece of evidence indicating that such a trafficking operation is really occurring.” On September 26, 1988, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that “based on a review of all information available to the FBI, these charges are completely unfounded.” On October 3, 1988, Mr. R.C. Steiner, chief of the U.S. National Central Bureau, which represents the United States in the international criminal investigative organization Interpol, said that its records “do not reflect any requests for criminal investigative assistance from either the police in the United States or the police of any foreign country concerning this matter.” On October 8, 1988, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter stated that “My government has made an exhaustive investigation of the charges and rumors related to this matter and both the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have concluded that they are totally groundless.” On June 6, 1989, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health James Mason and U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop released a lengthy letter in which they pointed out that “the technical and medical aspects of organ transplantation make it impossible to obtain and transplant organs secretly.” They stated, “The requirements of the process, including numerous highly trained professional personnel and sophisticated equipment, assure that any such activity would be detected and exposed,” stressing that “removals of organs is a complex surgical procedure, performed only in hospitals, and specialized technical arrangements are needed to preserve the organs.” Mason and Koop went on to point out, “Organ transplant procedures are also highly complex and must be performed in the highest level surgical facilities, most often in large hospitals affiliated with schools for the education of physicians.” “Because of the nature of the technology involved,” they concluded, “these activities could not be conducted in secret or makeshift facilities.” On June 7, 1993, Mexico’s “El Financiero” newspaper quoted Pablo Chapa, the director of complaints at Mexico City’s attorney general’s office, as stating, “I have not seen a single case where a person has been kidnapped and has later appeared with scars where his organs were taken, or his eyes were taken away. If these famous clandestine hospitals existed, we would have found out about them immediately.” Dr. Arturo Dib Kuri, director of Mexico’s National Registry of Transplants, stated, “I compare the rumor of stolen children whose organs are sold for transplant to a story saying that several thieves stole three (space) ships from Cape Canaveral to go to the moon.” CONCLUSION: A thorough examination of this issue demonstrates that rumors of child organ trafficking are a fictional “urban legend.” This myth derives its credibility from the fact that it speaks to widespread, largely unconscious anxieties about mutilation and death that have been stimulated by the dramatic advances made in the field of organ transplantation in recent years. The child organ trafficking rumor would perhaps be of interest only to modern folklorists if it were not for the extremely pernicious effects that it can have and has had. In addition to stimulating violent attacks on U.S. citizens and others, arousing widespread unjustified fears, and disrupting numerous international adoptions, false rumors of child organ trafficking threaten the extremely fragile system of voluntary organ donation, upon which many lives depend. Regrettably, previous reports on this subject by the Special Rapporteur have given undue credibility to child organ trafficking rumors, essentially placing them on a par with the denials. For example, the Special Rapporteur’s 1991 report (E\/CN.4\/1991\/51, page 7) states, regarding “the question of organ transplants affecting children,” “the rumours abound, and the denials are equally abundant.” But equating groundless rumors that do not stand up to logical scrutiny and which have never been substantiated with responsible, reasoned denials is false symmetry. The very fact that the Special Rapporteur has examined this issue for several years and has sent questionnaires to governments in which it is implicitly assumed that child organ trafficking is a real phenomenon is mistakenly seen by many as evidence that child organ trafficking actually occurs. For example, question number five of a “Questionnaire Relating to the Sale of Children’s Organs,” circulated by the Special Rapporteur in 1992, stated: The sale of children is mainly carried out for the purposes of organ transplantation. To what extent, and in what ways and forms, do these violations of children’s rights exist in your country? Please describe. The implicit assumption in this question is that child organ trafficking actually occurs. The assertion of the Special Rapporteur in his 1994 report that “There is mounting evidence of a market for children’s organs” is also unfortunate. In the absence of clear evidence that clandestine child organ trafficking takes place at all, mere allegations, which have been commonplace in the world press for years, should not be treated as anything more than groundless rumors. Given the ubiquitous nature of the false child organ trafficking rumor, the role that the Special Rapporteur has inadvertently played in this process, the groundlessness of the rumors, their demonstrated impossibility, and the tremendous harm that they have done and can do, the U.S. Information Agency respectfully requests that the Special Rapporteur give maximum attention and publicity to the information contained in this report, in order to counterbalance the undue credence that has unfortunately been given to false rumors of child organ trafficking in past reports by the Special Rapporteur.", "tags": "", "url": "https://opingsoc.com/research/human_organ_trafficking.html"},
  {"title":"DynCorp International, Capitalism and Child Sex Slave Trafficking", "text": "The creators of Capitalism socially constructed a concept that put the primary objective of survival as profit. People who understood Capitalism would know that everything and anything can be turned into a business to make a profit, including human beings themselves. There are no boundaries in this ideology. As time went on profits were to be made on everything including: war, death, birth, and health. Almost every aspect of humanity is being exploited to make a profit. The processes of Capitalism dehumanize people. Profits are more important than people and life is regarded cheaply. People die every day because of resource based wars, inferior quality of food, and poor environmental conditions. The modes of production for profit reign king among humanity. The CEOs, professionals, and venture capitalists who are paraded on media as gods; do not bat an eye when someone dies because of a medication they cannot afford. No one cares when a president starts an illegal war with no evidence and sends the lower classes to their deaths. The examples and the evidence is plenty. A system that turns everything into a business and exploits resources is not sustainable. A system that destroys the environment and does not build it, is not sustainable. For years people have been brainwashed through television and the media to believe that capitalism is the only way. But other ways are possible that advance both positively and equally. General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us before he left the presidency, of the military industrial complex. The power and might that comes with this production of power is something that all should be concerned with. Capitalism, media, entertainment, and materialism have blinded people from the important situations that need to be attended to, and developed a need for the motivation to participate in being mindful of our reality. The tentacles of the military industrial complex have led to a consistent amount of conflicts on a global scale. War profiteering and the testing of new war technology is motivation for creating major conflicts. It is plain to see the dominant hegemony position of the military industrial complex. The mainstream media pushes the war narrative in almost subliminal messaging - with fancy graphics, sounds, and colors. In the most recent U.S. government conflicts, mainstream media pushed specific dominant messages that created support for a position of war. What are these people trying to convince the population of? That war is peace and that it’s what protects the population from terrorists? When a billion-dollar industry finds a niche in the war market and the only thing beneficial for them is war; where is the motivation for peace? No weapons would get built and no profits would be made. The powerful war profiteering lobbying groups keep the revolving doors open for war and the defense industry. The military industrial complex has made the Defense industry a viable model for capital profiteering and investment. These companies receive millions in U.S. government contracts for military support and operations. The Defense companies make direct profit from war and violent conflicts around the world. For every war, their weapons are used, operations are conducted, revolving door contracts issued, and these companies make billions in revenue. The never ending global war on terror is a perpetual loop for companies like DynCorp and Blackwater to continuously make millions in profit. When there is no conflict, violence, or war they stand to become broke. They have no interest in the investment of peace because there’s no money to be made in that. The U.S. government’s glutton for war has created a never-ending demand for mercenaries. Over the years, the lack of oversight and regulation has led to war crimes and atrocities against innocent civilians in the countries that they occupy. The U.S. government continuing to issue contracts, despite the investigations and evidence against these companies, doesn’t do any justice to all those who have suffered at the hands of contractors like DynCorp. Under the Bill Clinton administration, DynCorp International was hired to conduct operations in Bosnia. DynCorp has been a worldwide force providing maintenance support to the U.S. military through contract field tiers (CFTs). This means that they operate with the U.S. military on the ground. They’re one of the U.S. government’s top twenty-five contractors. DynCorp was originally founded in 1946 as California Eastern Aviation Inc. by pilots returning from World War II, and the compnay has held government contracts ever since. DynCorp has expanded from aviation to other areas such as IT, computer software and even providing mercenaries. DynCorp offers their services worldwide and have run operations in Colombia, Haiti, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, UAE and more. According to documents obtained from the Department of Defense, DynCorp International formed a human sex trafficking ring on multiple U.S. military bases. There were investigations conducted after complaints from military personnel and a DynCorp whistleblower came forward. This problem was largely ignored by the U.S. military and DynCorp employees and executives. Many involved in the misconduct were never brought to justice, nor any of it covered by the mainstream media. Many were too focused on the Monica Lewinsky scandal that had confidently been played up by media, blacking out the scandal that was unraveling in the U.S. military. According to Donna Hugh’s and John Miller’s investigation, DynCorp whistleblower Ben Johnston filed a complaint against DynCorp with the U.S. Army. He was witness to children being raped and sold by DynCorp employees. Johnston explained that these DynCorp employees were purchasing young girls ages 12 to 15 years old, as sex slaves. They worked with a local mafia organization in the region. The military was aware of the problem with DynCorp but viewed it as a DynCorp problem. They chose not to intervene. As stated by Col. Braun, who was a base supervisor, the military was more concerned that their aircrafts were maintained and their needs met in the field. According to this investigation, DynCorp received $1 billion dollars in government contracts from 1995 to 2003. Even after the complaints against DynCorp the U.S. government continued to re-hire them for military operations overseas. The employees of DynCorp that were involved in the child sex slave trafficking were merely fired from their positions. No one was prosecuted or punished for the atrocities that were committed. Contractors like DynCorp go unchecked and unregulated by the government. According to the Department of Defense, they don’t have jurisdiction over the private contractors. Essentially the private contractors do not have to operate like the military does - they don’t have to follow any ethical or moral guidelines. This is part of the reason why many people who committed these crimes were not brought to justice or prosecuted for what they did. DynCorp is not the only private military company that has committed heinous crimes in other countries. There were several disturbing incidents involving companies like Blackwater, Titan, KBR, CACI International, and Triple Canopy committed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas of operation. Blackwater security guards murdered 17 civilians in Baghdad Nisour’s square. CACI International and Titan were involved with the Abu Ghuraib torture case. Another example of immoral and unethical behavior is when Jacob Washborne was involved in 3 unjustified shooting incidents. Before Jacob went on the operation he declared he wanted to kill somebody that day. The United States private military contractors have been responsible for some of the worst crimes against humanity on a global scale. Despite all the evidence and all the documentation, the U.S. government still employs many of these contractors to this very day. There has been no real oversight or regulation of these private military corporations. The lack of immediate controls over these situations has demonstrated that the U.S. military and government have no interest in the safety of human beings not complicit with their mission or operation. Human trafficking and child sex rings are nothing new and have been noted in history by the Greek and the Roman government elites. There’s evidence that a high profile member of the Roman government had young boys that he would bath with nude. He stated that he liked it when they bit him all over his naked body. There has been evidence of sexual abuse and rape of young children in that era of time. These types of acts are continued today in elite circles of the wealthy, many of whom are in positions of power and leadership. This is not just a domestic problem but a global one. There is a massive amount of information and research regarding the seriousness of the problem. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s the Catholic Church was exposed for child sexual abuse and rape committed by many of their priests since the 1950s. It was discovered by the Vatican and covered up until it was exposed years later. For many years, Catholic priests molested and raped possibly hundreds of thousands of children around the globe. Many of those priests were never prosecuted for their crimes. High profile members of the Vatican helped protect and cover up the crimes of their priests. These types of violations of humanity have been a widespread practice by elite circles of differing societal social contracts. Many other organizations have committed the same heinous crimes against innocent people and this unseemly trend has been perpetrated throughout time. As a society, we must be mindfully aware of things that have happened in the past to understand what is happening in the present. Most recently, internet activists called Anonymous helped expose and bring attention to the operations and participation of government leaders, agencies, and military regarding child sex rings within the United Kingdom. According to government investigations, these child sex slave rings have been in operation since the early 1970s. Coincidentally, during those times and through the present there have been increased reports of missing children. There have been many scandals and even some that come to the surface. In the late 1980s the Bush Administration was bringing young boys for late night “tours” of the White House. It even made newspaper headlines. A documentary called Conspiracy of Silence was supposed to be shown by the Discovery channel in the early 90s, but was threatened with restrictive legislation by the Bush Administration and told not to air the film. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased anonymously and they ordered all copies destroyed. A copy of the videotape was leaked anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp, who represented many of the abused children. He made the video available to retired F.B.I. chief, Ted L. Gunderson. The documentary interviewed the victims of sex slave trafficking. They gave detailed descriptions of people within the Republican Party such as Lawrence King who was a chairman of the party at the time. The boys that came for these late night tours were from the Nebraska based orphanage of Boys Town, which is a very well known orphanage in the United States. The human trafficking problem is not just isolated to the military or private military contractors but also criminal organizations that operate domestically in the United States. They have been operating under the “radar” in the United States, even though recently Dr. Phil had a child sex slave victim on his show and there have been multiple reports of missing children in metro areas like Washington D.C. and Atlanta that get left unmentioned. Oddly enough no arrests came from the Dr. Phil show. There was no mainstream media coverage of the 10 black teenage girls that went missing in one week in the Washington D.C. area. It wasn’t until recently that reports of sex slave rings have been getting cracked down on by the FBI. Largely these things get ignored by the mainstream media, and even people within the U.S. government have claimed that these issues are myths and rarely happen, when they happen much more frequently than most people know. According to the Congressional Research Service the estimate for persons trafficked is 2 to 4 million people annually. This includes worldwide data. Many people in elevated levels of leadership both in the military and government have ignored the problem. Some of those people in elevated levels of leadership are involved with the crimes that are being committed. The Monica Lewinsky scandal was used to distract the mainstream media and the public from the atrocities private military contractors were committing against innocent people abroad. The Bill Clinton administration was very aware of what was happening in Bosnia and Kosovo. There has been a pattern of certain events or leaks that happen. The Bush administration leaked classified CIA information to the press, which supposedly exposed a CIA agent. There were many illegal firings that Attorney General Antonio Gonzales was investigated for. Vice President Dick Cheney shot a man in the face and the man apologized to him for the inconvenient situation. Events like these are overly pushed by the mainstream media. Everyone covered these stories and brought more attention to them. Just about every single outlet was talking about how Dick Cheney shot a man in the face and the man apologized to him for it. Many controversial things happened during that administration, but people were distracted by the sensationalism of the headlines being played up by the mainstream media. These distractions occur in every administration. They are used for political edge and gain. The current Trump Administration is a very good example of the use of distraction. Everything President Trump does is sensationalized in the mainstream media. Even during the presidential election Trump’s every word and every action was controversial. Most of his media attention came free because of how much the media sensationalized him. People must expose these distractions for what they are and carefully examine what is not being talked about. One should ask themselves, when the mainstream media is pushing a specific event or story through the cultural industries, what is really happening beneath the surface? What narrative is the mainstream media trying to create? What is the story they’re trying to tell? To understand the present, one must understand the past. People tend to repeat themselves and adhere to specific familiar patterns. It should be no surprise that those who are awarded power over others will exploit them for their own interests. Even if it causes pain to another person, they feel a sense of entitlement, that they can and should have whatever they want. This has translated over centuries of elite circles of the wealthy. It is important to become more mindfully aware of the past and of the present. The more people become aware of what is going on, the more people can do to make the world a better place. No one should be exploited for money. No one should become anyone’s slave because someone else holds power over them. As people of this world, we should not accept that greed is glorified and rewarded. No one in this world should die or be murdered for profit or resources. No sick person should perish because they cannot afford the medication that could cure them. No person should die because another country wants their country’s resources. Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism all drive these motives against humanity. People should not have to sacrifice their lives for corporations or government systems. A balance is needed within these systems of governance. No group of people should exploit another group unfairly. Regulation and oversight should be in place to help balance the system. These people who operate at the very high levels of capitalism do whatever they please. These people must be exposed and their actions stopped. Government contractors like DynCorp should not go unregulated and unpunished for the things they’ve done. Too many loop holes are exploited within this system. DynCorp aided in the operation of child sex rings around the world while making money from the U.S. government. This systemic effect was created by layers of previous events. Human trafficking must get more exposure by the media. The more people report on things of this nature, the more humanity’s awareness will grow. Soon people will turn away from the mainstream media lies and find the real news. Only approved news is allowed on mainstream media. The time to stop the censorship of the internet is now. Things such as child sex trafficking being conducted by a U.S. government contractor, like DynCorp, will never be reported by media outlets like CNN or NBC. There is usually a mainstream media blackout of important conversations happening within the United States. Each of us has a responsibility to think critically and expose the truth whenever we can. We cannot allow these terrible things to keep happening under the noses of the many. Events are disguised and people are distracted so no one will do anything about it. As decent human beings, we must all hold each other to a higher standard and do what we can to make a positive difference. Together as a collective we can co-create a reality of equality, dignity, and respect. These goals can be obtained if we stay strong and diligent regarding the exposure of truths in the pursuit of justice and equality. To those who feel discouraged, burnt out, or indifferent to the events and situations occurring in our shared, global, co-created reality: do not give up. Do not become callous in your communication with others. It is achievable, this notion of treating all living things with dignity and respect. It is achievable, that we can relinquish our corrupt leadership that controls and influences the global population. We are making a call to all human beings, energies, and living creatures. Create for yourself an open mind that can repel negative connotations and actions that seek to create an imbalance of power within this social system of control. Take solace in the fact that there are other people out there who do care, who do want to make a difference no matter how hard the task. It is our human ability to tolerate so much pain, so much struggle and still be able to love. We want you to know that we have not given up and we will not give up. It takes all of us to make great change. Lay down your laziness. Lay down your ego. Lay down your selfishness. We all want a good life and we all want to be successful. Help break this system of distraction, materialism, and greed. It is reprehensible that human beings die undeserving and at the hands of those who hold more wealth than them. It is reprehensible that it’s legal to make profit off of health, life, and death. There are those that will tell you, “This is the way it is. Things will never change.” “You can’t make a difference.” The system depends on people like this to reinforce the synthetic reality. The system wants us to think things will never change and we they can’t do anything about the problems of today. There is a small group of people who want to maintain status quo. They want to maintain that a small group of people get an unequal and excessive amount of profit. These people of course don’t want anything to change because they hold the majority of power, and they hold majority of control, even though they are the minority. It is no mistake that travel or mobility is only allowed through socioeconomic status. The more currency you hold the farther you can travel down the river through the banks. “They” (1%) control the flow of human capital\/assets. “They” determine your “official” level of education. “They” determine how far you can travel and where you can go. “They” control your quality of food. “They” control your wages. “They” control your physical, mental, and communication mobility. We set to change this social construct created by the global ultra wealthy.

	{"title":"Propaganda & Information Ops", "text": "PART ONE: PropOrNot, The Washington Post &amp; the CIA. PropOrNot warns people about Russian propaganda online. “Russia is manipulating US public opinion through online propaganda”. This would be a great service if it was real. Who wouldn’t want to know if they were being manipulated? Unfortunately their definition of online propaganda is basically: alternative media sites or blogs that contain any criticism of US foreign policy, Hillary Clinton, Ukrainian Ultra-Nationalists and US involvement in the war in Syria. They themselves are propagandists. Their blacklist of “Russian propaganda sites” includes Truthdig, Wikileaks, True Activist, Max Keiser, Ron Paul Institute, Zero Hedge and many more. They want these sites to be investigated by the federal government and prosecuted under the Espionage Act as Russian spies. If you promise to stop posting the content they don’t want you to post, you can talk to them about possibly being removed from the list. Washington Post Disgracefully Promotes a McCarthyite Blacklist From a New, Hidden, and Very Shady Group: https:\/\/archive.fo\/DBT3C The people behind PropOrNot have decided to remain anonymous. There’s no Whois information on the website’s registrant because they hide behind a service called Domain By Proxy. https:\/\/whois.icann.org\/en\/lookup?name=propornot.com No one knows who is really behind the site, but we do have some clues as to what groups and people are involved in this wave of “fake news” and Cold War hysteria. Not knowing who is behind the website, the Washington Post still published an article claiming PropOrNot was comprised of “experts” and called out alternative media for Russian propaganda. Because of heavy criticism the Post was forced to add a disclaimer to their article. “The Post, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot’s findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so.” Too little, too late, and that’s why they continue to print maliciously false claims. Even if they retracted the article the damage has been done. The narrative has become the weapon for the government and mainstream media to use against our constitutional rights. Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election, experts say (Washington Post): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/DnEgL ​It should also be mentioned that the Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. Here are a few interesting facts about Bezos: Amazon has a $600 million cloud contract with the CIA. Bezos was one of the very early investors in Google. His grandfather was regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and supervised Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Laboratories. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times have had a close working relationship with the CIA since the 1950’s. Other news agencies also worked with the CIA and the White House, printing anything they were told. The Washington Post and New York Times are long standing favorites of the CIA – tools to push their narrative, and willing partners in the decades long CIA PSYOP against the American people. “CIA secret ties with the Post and other Fawning Corporate Media (FCM) go back several decades. After leaving the Post in 1977, Carl Bernstein wrote a major story for Rolling Stone (Oct. 20, 1977) showing how the FCM worked hand in glove with the CIA and how this was all covered up by the committee led by (Senator) Frank Church in 1975.” –Institute for Public Accuracy CIA Cloud over Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/xDgLI Jeff Bezos: Early Life and Education: https:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/bezos-life-archive The CIA and the Media - 1977 (Carl Bernstein): https:\\/\\/archive.is\\/2ovBK “You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month.” – CIA operative discussing with Philip Graham, editor Washington Post, on the availability and prices of journalists willing to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories. “Katherine The Great,” by Deborah Davis​ “The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media.” – William Colby, former CIA Director, cited by Dave Mcgowan, “Derailing Democracy” Mockingbird: The Subversion Of The Free Press By The CIA \\/ How the Washington Post Censors the News: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/huvdH The CIA and the Press: When the Washington Post Ran the CIA’s Propaganda Network: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/aBUQF PART TWO: The Return of Cold War Legislation.

Title V — Matters relating to foreign countries, Section 501, calls for a “committee to counter active measures by Russia to exert covert influence over people and governments.” ​“Active measures by Russia,” include “media manipulation”, “disinformation” and “incitement”. So, if we continue to follow this narrative, we have alternative media sites spreading “Russian propaganda” and disinformation that manipulated the US presidential election. They have also supposedly incited violence and hatred for US foreign policy. (Otherwise we Americans would have no reason to criticize these fair, just and noble policies). Oh, and the scoundrels should be charged with espionage! Arrrr ye scurvy dogs! President Obama then signs into law an intelligence authorization, to create a committee that will counter these active measures by Russia. We should also mention that “assassinations” and “terrorist acts” are shown on the same list as “disinformation” and “media manipulation”. It’s possible PropOrNot may just get their wish for alternative media to be investigated for espionage.

Anything that doesn’t agree with the government’s narrative can be considered Russian propaganda. We’ve already witnessed this by the fake news hysteria that’s being spread by the establishment. We are witnessing the US pivot to fascism and dictatorship, just like all the countries the US government has overthrown. You’ve probably heard the poem by Pastor Martin Niemöller, about the cowardice of German intellectuals following the Nazi’s rise to power: ​ “First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out– Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out– Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out– Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.” It’s time to speak, because we are coming close to that last line of the poem. ​​​ Have the chickens come home to roost? This is a time when it is extremely important to think before we act. When joining a protest we should question what is actually being protested, and what are the demands, the goals? Are there any? Protest and mass disruption, especially that which is violent or destructive can easily be manipulated, co-opted and spun to advance the establishment’s agenda. This is usually the antithesis of what is good for we the people. We’ve already started to see the signs of a CIA and Soros sponsored coup or “color revolution” in the US. There is a massive disinformation campaign going on and we may be entering the 2nd stage, “Violent Street Demonstrations”. That’s why it’s always imperative to question. “Most U.S. coups follow a model that has hardly changed between 1953 and the latest coup in Ukraine in 2014. This model has three stages”: 1) Creating and strengthening opposition forces “In the early stages of a U.S. plan for regime change, there is little difference between the methods used to achieve it at the ballot box or by an anti-constitutional coup. Many of these tools and methods were developed to install right-wing governments in occupied countries in Europe and Asia after World War II. They include forming and funding conservative political parties, student groups, trade unions and media outlets, and running well-oiled propaganda campaigns both in the country being targeted and in regional, international and U.S. media.” 2) Violent street demonstrations “In the West, we tend to interpret street demonstrations as representing surges of populism and democracy. But we should distinguish left-wing demonstrations against right-wing governments from the kind of violent right-wing demonstrations that have always been part of U.S. regime change strategy.” 3) The coup d’etat “The creation and grooming of opposition forces and the spread of violence in the streets are deliberate strategies to create a state of emergency as a pretext for removing an elected or constitutional government and seizing power.” America’s Coup Machine: Destroying Democracy Since 1953: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/XMRIc What is a color revolution? “Participants in the color revolutions have mostly used nonviolent resistance, also called civil resistance. Such methods as demonstrations, strikes and interventions have been (used to) protest against governments seen as corrupt and\\/or authoritarian, and to advocate democracy; and they have also created strong pressure for change. These movements all adopted a specific color or flower as their symbol. The color revolutions are notable for the important role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and particularly student activists in organizing creative non-violent resistance.” Color Revolution (Wikipedia): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/R9YAE “What the Wikipedia article fails to mention is the massive foreign funding, and at least any notion that color revolutions are psychosocial operations of deception. It’s a fact that Western governments (especially the US government) and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (Soros) spend millions of dollars to co-opt and “channel” local populations of targeted countries against their own political leadership. Empty democracy slogans and flashy colors aside, we argue that color revolutions are good old-fashioned regime change operations: destabilization without the tanks. The secret ingredient is a sophisticated science used to manipulate emotions and circumvent critical thinking. History shows that, to much of the power elite, humanity is seen as a collection of nerve endings to be pushed and pulled one way or the other, sometimes made to tremble in fear, sometimes made to salivate like Pavlov’s dogs. These days the manipulation is so pervasive, so subtle, so effective, that even critical individuals at times must necessarily fail to recognize how often–or in what context–they have fallen prey. Of course fear is the most obvious emotion played upon to effect massive social change. One need only to reflect upon the last ten years, since 9\\/11, to know that fear is a primary instrument used to initiate and justify dangerous shifts in public policy. But as humanity has been physiologically equipped with a range of emotions, and is not merely arrested and controlled by fear alone, a strata of behavioral and political science also found it useful to master the flip-side of the emotional spectrum, and by that we mean desire, and all that drives groups of individuals to act, even in the face of fear, in pursuit of something worthwhile. Looking beneath the facade of the color revolutionary movement we also find a desire-based behavioral structure, in particular one that has been built upon historical lessons offered by social movements and periods of political upheaval.” “It then makes sense that the personnel of such operations include perception managers, PR firms, pollsters and opinion-makers in the social media. Through the operational infrastructure, these entities work in close coordination with intelligence agents, local and foreign activists, strategists and tacticians, tax-exempt foundations, governmental agencies, and a host of non- governmental organizations. Collectively, their job is to make a palace coup (of their sponsorship) seem like a social revolution; to help fill the streets with fearless demonstrators advocating on behalf of a government of their choosing, which then legitimizes the sham governments with the authenticity of popular democracy and revolutionary fervor. Because the operatives perform much of their craft in the open, their effectiveness is heavily predicated upon their ability to veil the influence backing them, and the long-term intentions guiding their work. Their effectiveness is predicated on their ability to deceive, targeting both local populations and foreign audiences with highly-misleading interpretations of the underlying causes provoking these events.” Color Revolutions and Geopolitics (See “About Us” section): ​ https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/ytcov Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act (S.3274): A month after the previously mentioned propaganda bill was passed (H.R. 6393), the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act (S.3274) was passed and placed into the NDAA for 2017 (S.2943). Signed by Obama on December 23rd, 2016. This bill calls for the creation of a “Center”, now named the Global Engagement Center, “to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining United States national security interests.” “The legislation establishes a fund to help train local journalists and provide grants and contracts to NGOs, civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government with experience in identifying and analyzing the latest trends in foreign government disinformation techniques.” Senate Passes Major Portman-Murphy Counter-Propaganda Bill as Part of NDAA: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/BEA8j Oh, great, will PropOrNot be one of them? So in essence, this bill is a bunch of money being thrown at a new propaganda agency. We should call it the Ministry of Truth. That’s got a catchy ring to it. Senators that sponsored the bill claim it will only be used against foreign agents in foreign countries. But the bill says: “foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation.” The article below by Naked Capitalism* does a great job in going over the ambiguities in the bill. For example, “foreign state and non-state propaganda”; do they mean “foreign non-state actors” or just “non-state actors”? He found a line from a previous NDAA that says something similar: “including threats from foreign countries and foreign non-state actors.” In this statement there’s no ambiguity, it’s very clear they are only referring to foreign actors. The bill that was just passed could be construed to mean both foreign and domestic “non-state propaganda”. *Does the “Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act” Apply to ….Alternative Media?: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/oVltF A New Center for Global Engagement: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/6imdZ Smith-Mundi Act Amendment - Lifting the Ban on Domestic Propaganda: It really does go on and on and on…. so here’s the general info: By amending the Smith-Mundi Act in the NDAA for 2013, essentially a ban on domestic propaganda was lifted. In the US we are now able to hear the same propaganda the US government airs in foreign countries. ​Overview from Wikipedia: “Under § 501 of the Smith–Mundt Act of 1948, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens, until July 2013 when it was repealed in the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013. The intent of the legislation in 1948 was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by its own government.” Voice of America: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/Ra3GX “The U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (Public Law 80-402), popularly called the Smith–Mundt Act, specifies the terms in which the United States government can engage global audiences, also known as propaganda. (…) signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on January 27, 1948.” “The shift from wartime to peacetime “propaganda” operations was not taken lightly by Congress, especially with fresh memories of President Woodrow Wilson’s Committee on Public Information (CPI), President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Office of War Information (OWI), and the Nazi propaganda machine, but there were other, deeper concerns on which Congress focused.” Smith–Mundt Act: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/g2xAU Wait… what was the purpose of the original legislation? ” …to protect the American public from propaganda actions by its own government. “ ​I think we can safely say at this point that Congress no longer gives a damn about the American people. The real reasons why: The following article was written in 2012 prior to the passing of this amendment. We want to give a shout out to an amazing journalist that is greatly missed, Michael Hastings. We won’t forget. “(…) the law would allow “U.S. propaganda intended to influence foreign audiences to be used on the domestic population.” ​”The new law would give sweeping powers to the government to push television, radio, newspaper, and social media onto the U.S. public. “It removes the protection for Americans,” says a Pentagon official who is concerned about the law. “It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false. According to this official, “senior public affairs” officers within the Department of Defense want to “get rid” of Smith-Mundt and other restrictions because it prevents information activities designed to prop up unpopular policies—like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.” Congressmen Seek To Lift Propaganda Ban (Michael Hastings, 2012): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/rYEgP The asinine excuses: “It’s being branded by proponents as an attempt at transparency, but critics of a new law say the United States government just got the green-light to use propaganda made for foreign audiences on the American public.” US ends ban on ‘domestic propaganda’: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/uzofR ​Transparency?!

Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, especially those who serve in our Congress. The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year. It is now clear that so-called fake news can have real world consequences. It’s a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly. Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government’s response to foreign propaganda, and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news. It’s imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives.” Hillary Reemerges, Slams “Dangerous Epidemic” Of Fake News: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/lOrjv\\/ Donald Trump: “We’re losing a lot of people because of the internet,” Trump said. “We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what’s happening.

It’s us against the establishment. It always has been. Don’t forget that. The rich elites &amp; politicians have more in common with each other than they will ever have with any of us. Mainstream media has been their greatest weapon, printing lies and propaganda to influence our opinions, while keeping us divided and hating one another. It’s time to turn around and take their weapon away. Mainstream media must be weakened. They are only as strong as we allow them to be. “The proletariat (\\/ˌproʊlᵻˈtɛəri.ət\\/ from Latin proletarius) is a term for the class of wage-earners, in a capitalist society, whose only possession of significant material value is their labor-power (their ability to work); a member of such a class is a proletarian.” “If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it?” –George Orwell, 1984 Link PDF: http:\\/\\/www.planetebook.com\\/ebooks\\/1984.pdf Archive PDF: https:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/g-orwell-84 The First Amendment is Dying: With the propaganda bills and the calls for censorship, we have a very, very serious threat against our First Amendment rights. These actions can knock out 3 of the 5 pillars of the First Amendment. Congress shall make no law I. respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; II. or abridging the freedom of speech, III. or of the press; IV. or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, V. and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Hell, we might as well knock out the 4th one and make sure the last one is completely dead. We don’t want people complaining or criticizing the government. In the spirit of killing our First Amendment rights, Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, has introduced his Preventing Economic Disruption Act (PEDA), and proposes that “disruptive” protestors be charged with “economic terrorism”: “The outrageous bill, which has now been formally introduced for consideration during the 2017 legislative session, would make any form of protest that causes an “economic disruption” a class C felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. It wouldn’t just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism, it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes a protest that authorities deem as “disruptive.” Broadly interpreted, this law could apply to time honored traditions of nonviolent dissent like boycotts and civil disobedience.” URGENT: proposed law would charge protesters with terrorism: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/MfOC8 Washington Lawmaker Proposes Bill To Charge Protesters With “Economic Terrorism”: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/NitDP PART FOUR: Manipulation &amp; Information Operations. Tim Snyder: Newspeak &amp; the Rewriting of History: Let’s circle back to PropOrNot, our “friendly neighborhood” propaganda agency. The first person that seems to have mentioned and promoted PropOrNot in print was Yale history professor Tim Snyder. This was before PropOrNot got exposure from the Washington Post. Snyder is an American historian, author, and academic specializing in the history of Central and Eastern Europe and the Holocaust. He’s also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Note his specialization in the history of Central and Eastern Europe, it will be important later. He’s the State Department’s favorite go-to Eastern European historian and academic, especially when it comes to Ukraine. “The worst offender amongst public intellectuals is Yale professor Tim Snyder. Snyder is one of the most often cited authors in USAID publications since he began his doctoral work at Oxford. One could call him the intellectual darling of the State Department’s Eastern European desk. He became more publicly active during the 2014 Ukraine crisis which he used to push his warmed over cold-war “Stalin was as bad as Hitler” line of liberalism. No sane person would argue for the humanitarian nature of Stalinism, but Snyder’s reading and writing history omits many actors from the Eastern European stage of history that resisted both authoritarian nationalism and authoritarian communism from a perspective that was not centrist, authoritarian and beholden to business elites.” –Gary Bello ​His rhetoric is pretty sneaky and subtle. At first glance he seems like someone who truly does care about freedom and the constitution, but upon closer examination he’s just another puppet. He wrote a post called “20 Lessons from the 20th Century on How to Survive in Trump’s America.” Originally it was a private Facebook post, then it was posted by several online media sites. “#9: Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Bookmark PropOrNot and other sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.” Does he not realize the “Russian propaganda” listed on PropOrNot’s website is alternative media, and some of the only investigative journalism that is fighting for freedom and truth? I think he does. #1: “Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You’ve already done this, haven’t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.” 20 Lessons from the 20th Century on How to Survive in Trump’s America (Tim Snyder): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/qLjHF Okay, so sounds good on the surface right? But why is he using the word “unfreedom”? Isn’t that one of the examples of Newspeak in Orwell’s 1984? Should we ask him if he thinks unfreedom is doubleplusgood or doubleplusungood? The Mockingbird Paper has a great breakdown of Snyder’s 20 lessons. It’s worth reading to get an idea of how sneaky the Establishment can be. Pay close attention to the words and images being used in mainstream media, they’re trying to change the way we think and even our understanding of words and ideas. Always question. “Yale Professor Snyder does not know that “unfreedom” is not a word. Repression is the word he is looking for. More importantly “Do not Obey in advance”? Wrong. If you see a bad program coming, plan to disobey in advance. Build the secret rooms in your attic now to hide immigrants and dissidents later.” –Gary Bello 20 Ways to defeat both fascism and the new McCarthyism: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/j1ixb Inform and Influence Operations (IIO): “We also must restrict fake news sites, fake news, and their spread on social media and elsewhere. Detractors will cite the first amendment, but the issue is national security, so preventing information designed to undermine our freedom more than justifies such a law.” – Joel Harding Americans keep looking away from the election’s most alarming story (Joel Harding): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/Z6KcR The next person possibly connected to PropOrNot is Joel Harding. There’s a lot of information on Harding, but first we’ll be giving an overview of what Information Operations (IO) are, and most importantly, Influence Operations. (We’re jumping into data mode now). Influence Operations: “Influence operations are focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of leaders, groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate commander’s intent, and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing behavior or a change in the adversary’s decision cycle, which aligns with the commander’s objectives. The military capabilities of influence operations are psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC), operations security (OPSEC), counterintelligence (CI) operations, counterpropaganda operations and public affairs (PA) operations.” Information Operations: “Information Operations. The integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own. Also called IO.” What are Information Operations?: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/CMA9 The RAND Corporation (Global Policy Think Tank): “Our definition of influence operations has some resemblance to the joint operations definition for STRATCOMM that was approved in December 2006, which also focuses on the communication of messages to target audiences that are synchronized with military or other actions and nonkinetic activities: Focused US Government efforts to understand and engage key audiences in order to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of US Government interests, policies, and objectives through the use of coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national power.” “In our usage, influence operations primarily consist of nonkinetic, communications-related, and informational activities that aim to affect cognitive, psychological, motivational, ideational, ideological, and moral characteristics of a target audience, and include: public affairs (PA) IO and most of its disciplines, but especially psychological operations (PSYOP) STRATCOMM activities the public relations–oriented parts of civil-military operations (CMO), including civil affairs (CA)” “We use “influence operations” as an umbrella term that includes military activities (e.g., IO, PA, military support to diplomacy and public diplomacy, and parts of CA and CMO) and civilian ones (comprising both public and covert—or clandestine—efforts).” RAND Corporation: Foundations of Effective Influence Operations A Framework for Enhancing Army Capabilities: Link PDF: https:\\/\\/www.rand.org\\/content\\/dam\\/rand\\/pubs\\/monographs\\/2009\\/RAND_MG654.pdf Archive PDF: https:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/RAND-MG654 Joint Publication 3-13: Information Operations: Link PDF: http:\\/\\/www.dtic.mil\\/doctrine\\/new_pubs\\/jp3_13.pdf Archive PDF: https:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/jp-3-13-io U.S. Army FM 3-13 Inform and Influence Activities Draft Manual: Link PDF: https:\\/\\/info.publicintelligence.net\\/USArmy-InformInfluence.pdf Archive PDF: https:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/iio-army Joel Harding &amp; Ukraine’s Ministry of Information Policy: According to Harding’s LinkedIn profile, he has specialized in Russian Information Warfare for at least 30+ months. Experience: “My blog, ‘To Inform is to Influence’, deals with propaganda, exposing propaganda and highlighting the intricacies and nuances of propaganda at all levels. I am currently focusing on the Ukraine\\/Russia information war with a simultaneous heavy emphasis on the accompanying hybrid war. I currently teach classes about Russian Information Warfare and a second class on Propaganda\\/Agitprop.” “Specialties: Information Operations\\/Information Warfare, Public Diplomacy, Strategic Communication, Counter-Disinformation, Electronic Warfare, Deception, Operational Security, Cyberwar, Intelligence, Special Forces and Special Operations.” “Primary author Ukraine National Strategy for Information Policy, submitted in 2015 and again in 2016.” “Worked as Information Operations Intelligence Officer on Joint Staff from 1996 until 1999. Wrote J2 portion of Eligible Receiver, coordinated J2 response, lead US Government ‘Tiger Team’ to DISA and wrote report for US Government response. Wrote numerous US intelligence reports on state-sponsored hacker and other cyber programs. Served as J2 Liaison for IO to NSA, CIA, DISA, FBI and others. From 1999 until 2000 worked in the New York City area effort to establish an IO research facility supporting the United Nations.” Joel Harding LinkedIn Profile: https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/K46A5 Harding is the founder of Information Operations Holistic Organizers (IOHO) You can see from his own words that he’s an Information Operations Specialist, who deals with the “dissemination of information and propaganda”. He is “currently focusing on the Ukraine\\/Russia information war “. “​Information operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical, operational and strategic information about an competitor as well as the dissemination of information and propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an competitor or adversary in the corporate, government or military realm. It is our job to maximize your advantages over your competitor while minimizing your competitor. We work on the national level down to the individual level. We seek to give you every advantage possible in order to advance your position, increase your reputation, and maximize your standing in your field.” Information Operations Holistic Organizers (IOHO): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/gMoFL Harding says he is the “primary author Ukraine National Strategy for Information Policy, submitted in 2015 and again in 2016”. In December 2014 the Ministry of Information Policy was established in Ukraine. “Propornot is another incarnation of Stopfake or the Daily Dot. Both of these propaganda sites have been doing the same essential thing as propornot since the beginning of the 2014 Coup in Ukraine.” “The people that wrote the Ukrainian information policy and developed the methods for the “Myrotvorets” or Peacemaker website did so with the sole goal of creating a clearinghouse for killing dissent and dissenters.” ​”The ministry oversees information policy in Ukraine. According to the first Minister of Information, Yuriy Stets, one of the goals of its formation was to counteract “Russian information aggression” amidst pro-Russian unrest across Ukraine, and the ongoing war in the Donbass region. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that the main function of the ministry is to stop ‘the spreading of biased information about Ukraine’.” “Prior to its establishment, many Ukrainian journalists protested the creation of the ministry. They cited concerns that the ministry would ‘open the way to grave excesses’ in restricting free speech, and that the ministry would inhibit journalists’ work. Journalists demonstrating outside the parliament building said that the creation of the ministry was equivalent to “a step back to the USSR”. The ministry was given the satirical appellation “Ministry of Truth”, a reference to George Orwell’s dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Reporters without Borders strongly opposed the creation of the ministry, and said that it was a ‘retrograde step’.” Ministry of Information Policy (Ukraine): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\\/ZcyZN The propaganda and counter-propaganda center to be created in the US following the passing of the “Countering Russian Propaganda and Disinformation Act” sounds a lot like the Ukraine’s Ministry of Information Policy. As the “primary author of Ukraine’s National Information Policy”, Harding along with the Ministry of Information Policy would have been a part of the creation of the Ukrainian website “PeaceMaker” (Myrotvorets), which is similar to PropOrNot. The base model for PropOrNot is the Ukrainian website “PeaceMaker” which gained fame in March 2015.

The site reflects the work of NGO ″Myrotvorets center″, led by Roman Zaitsev, former employee of Lugansk Security Service of Ukraine office (SBU).” “The website is curated by the government, law-enforcement and intelligence agency Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and promoted by Advisor to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Anton Gerashenko.” “In April 2015 the website published the home addresses of Ukrainian writer Oles Buzina and former Verkhovna Rada parliamentarian Oleg Kalashnikov just days before they were assassinated.” “In 7 May 2016 the website published the personal data of 4,508 journalists and other media staff from all over the world who had worked (or had received accreditation to work) on the uncontrolled by Ukrainian Government territory of Donbass, and therefore “cooperated with terrorists.” Myrotvorets (Wikipedia): https:\\/\\/archive.fo\/MGP7X Harding says he’s spoken to the people behind PropOrNot: “I trust them and I do not say that easily or often. PropOrNot is legitimate, they have my seal of approval.” PropOrNot used Harding’s byline on the first page of their report condemning Counterpunch as Russian propaganda. Since then, Counterpunch was able to convince PropOrNot they weren’t Russian propagandists and were removed from the site. PropOrNot – They’re Real, They’re Mad as Hell, And I Trust Them (Joel Harding): https:\/\/archive.fo\/toD82 CounterPunch as Russian Propagandists: the Washington Post’s Shallow Smear: https:\/\/archive.fo\/rWbwz Obama and Propornot: https:\/\/archive.fo\/KYwFx Here are excerpts from a blog by Joel Harding sharing his experience meeting with members of Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) in the U.S.: “Last evening I had dinner with four Members of Parliament (MP) from Ukraine. It is actually called the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Taras Pastukh, Victoria Ptashnyk, Aliona Shkrum, and Anna Romanova were accompanied by a long-time friend of mine, Christina. (Krystyna V. Dobrovolska, a U.S. Embassy-assigned government liaison and translator who escorted the delegates from Kyiv during their visits to Albany and Washington). I need to give a brief bit of history before proceeding, about the Ministry of Information Policy (Ukrainian: Міністерство інформаційної політики; abbreviated MIP). The MIP was founded on 2 December 2014. Shortly after I was contacted and I produced a “National Information Strategy for Ukraine” on their behalf. After various corrections, I submitted the last version on 2 January 2014. It was apparent, however, that their interest was in cyber only, which is only one of many aspects of ‘information operations’. We discussed EU efforts to counter Russian propaganda, installing an office in Kyiv (which produces the Disinformation Review). We also discussed the NATO’s StratCom COE in Riga Latvia. We also discussed various voluntary and NGO funded efforts, such as Inform Napalm, Stop Fake.org, and how these efforts are very effective but, collectively, fall short of what is necessary. Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava! Слава Україні! Героям слава! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!” On a Ukraine National Information Strategy (Joel Harding): https:\/\/archive.fo\/zuYqR Albany- area Ukrainian Americans host delegation of Verkhovna Rada deputies: https:\/\/archive.fo\/RedCE Harding has worked for the current Ukrainian government, which is officially recognized by the US and was placed into power by the CIA\/MI6\/Mossad. (More on that later). PART FIVE: Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) &amp; Bandera: Here’s where it gets a bit complicated. Understanding the history of certain political groups in Ukraine is important to untangle the web of propaganda being spun by factions of the US gov’t, mainstream media and US allied intelligence agencies. This all relates to what has been happening in Ukraine (which some call the Euromaiden Revolution and others call the Ukrainian Coup of 2014), why the U.S. is returning to McCarthyism, repressing our rights and seems to be recklessly pushing for a war with Russia. Later we will be releasing more information on the history of the OSS\/CIA and Ukrainian Nationalist parties going back to WWII. Ok, back to Joel Harding… Take a look at the slogan at the end of his blog entry: “Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava! Слава Україні! Героям слава! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!” “Glory to Ukraine (Ukrainian: Слава Україні! Героям слава!, Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava!; translated as: Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!) is a Ukrainian greeting and slogan. “Glory to Ukraine” first appeared as a motto during the Ukrainian War of Independence (1917 - 1921), with the second part of greeting being commonly used by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The phrase has undergone a resurgence in recent times, becoming a popular and prominent refrain during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.” Glory to Ukraine (Wikipedia): https:\/\/archive.fo\/0ammw This is one of the very early tweets from PropOrNot: “Героям слава!” translates to “Glory to the heroes!” If we remember from above, this last part of the slogan was commonly used by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. PropOrNot Twitter Post: Link: https:\/\/twitter.com\/propornot\/status\/799314450893438976 Archive (no image): https:\/\/archive.fo\/FrCCg Another interesting thing of note is the website the above article is from: rferl.org. Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty (RFE\/RL). It’s a US government funded broadcasting organization similar to Voice of America (VOA). RFE\/RL and VOA are both supervised by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). The CIA funded RFE\/RL until 1972. So we have PropOrNot accusing alternative media of being Russian propaganda, while they’re posting articles from an arm of the US propaganda apparatus. It’s sounding more and more like the US intelligence community is involved, along with their OUN-B fascist Ukrainian friends. On a side note, Joel Harding happens to be friends with one of the Board Members of the BBG, Matt Armstrong. (As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was an ex-officio member of the BBG from 2009-2013). “I consider Matt to be the preeminent expert on the Smith Mundt Act, I have a sneaking suspicion he was involved in crafting H.R.5736 — the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012.” –Joel Harding Matt Armstrong to the BBG! (Joel Harding): https:\/\/archive.fo\/Y8iQd Matt Armstrong, BBG Board Member: https:\/\/archive.fo\/aqPt2 What a coincidence, that’s the provision lifting the ban on the propaganda bill. There is a very interesting history between the OSS\/CIA, OUN-B and Nazi’s. Unfortunately we’re only taught the whitewashed version of history. We will have a second release containing unclassified CIA documents, among other resources that will help explain the relationship between the CIA and Ukraine. Ukrainian Insurgent Army: “Ukrayins’ka Povstans’ka Armiya or UPA was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army. The political leadership of the army belonged to the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists—Bandera. (OUN-B)” “The OUN’s stated immediate goal was the re-establishment of a united, independent, mono-ethnic national state on Ukrainian ethnic territory. Violence was accepted as a political tool against foreign as well as domestic enemies of their cause, which was to be achieved by a national revolution led by a dictatorship that would drive out what they considered to be occupying powers and set up a government representing all regions and social groups. The organization began as a resistance group and developed into a guerrilla army.” “During its existence, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army fought against the Poles and the Soviets as their primary opponents, although the organization also fought against the Germans starting from February 1943 - with many cases of collaboration with the German forces in the fight against Soviet partisan units. From late spring 1944, the UPA and Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists-B (OUN-B)—faced with Soviet advances—also temporarily cooperated with German forces against the Soviets and Poles in the hope of creating an independent Ukrainian state. ​The OUN also played a substantial role in the ethnic cleansing of the Polish population of Volhynia and East Galicia.” Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Wikipedia): https:\/\/archive.fo\/6zvOw Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists: “The OUN sought to infiltrate legal political parties, universities and other political structures and institutions. As revolutionary ultra-nationalists the OUN have been characterized by some historians as fascist. The OUN’s strategy to achieve Ukrainian independence included violence and terrorism against perceived foreign and domestic enemies.” “During the Cold War, the OUN was covertly supported by western intelligence agencies, including the CIA.” “In 1940, the OUN split into two parts. The older, more moderate members, supported Andriy Melnyk (OUN-M) while the younger and more radical members supported Stepan Bandera (OUN-B).” “The older faction was more politically moderate, and adhered to an officer’s code of honor and standards of military discipline that prevented them from fully following the belief that any means could be used to achieve the goal. In contrast, the younger faction was more impulsive, violent, and ruthless. The older leaders living in exile admired aspects of Benito Mussolini’s fascism but condemned Nazism while the younger more radical members based within Ukraine admired fascist ideas and methods as practiced by the Nazis.” Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (Wikipedia): https:\/\/archive.fo\/hDHit Mykola Lebed: “Mykola Lebed, as leader of the OUN-B and part of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, was considered a war criminal and responsible for the genocide of Poles in Volhynia and East Galicia. He was sentenced to death, later escaped and then emigrated to the US in 1949. Through his CIA funded organization, Prolog Research Corporation, he gathered intellegence on the Soviet Union. The CIA project name was AERODYNAMIC. The CIA considered him to be a valuable asset until at least 1991. He died in 1998.” “In a government reports publication, published by the National Archives, Lebed is being suspected of having collaborated with Nazi Germany. Lebed was described as a “Ukrainian fascist leader and suspected Nazi collaborator”, and later labeled as a ‘well-known sadist and collaborator of the Germans” by United States Army counterintelligence.’” Mykola Lebed (Wikipedia): https:\/\/archive.fo\/WrwF7 Hitler’s Shadow: Nazi War Criminals, U.S.Intelligence, and the Cold War (published by the National Archives): Link PDF: https:\/\/www.archives.gov\/files\/iwg\/reports\/hitlers-shadow.pdf Archive PDF: https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/hitlers-shadow National Guard of Ukraine - Azov Battalion: Initially a volunteer unit, the Azov Battalion was incorporated into the Ukrainian National Guard in November 2014. In early reports members were open about the fact that they were neo-Nazi’s and white supremacists. Although they use Nazi symbols like the swastika, SS Armanen runes, and the Wolfsangel, the soldiers in the Azov Battalion now claim they aren’t Nazi’s, but “National Socialists”. It sounds like at some point they received disinformation training from the US. Etymology of the Word Nazi: “1930, noun and adjective, from German Nazi, abbreviation of German pronunciation of Nationalsozialist (based on earlier German sozi, popular abbreviation of “socialist”), from Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei “National Socialist German Workers’ Party,” led by Hitler from 1920.” “Before 1930, party members had been called in English National Socialists, which dates from 1923. The use of Nazi Germany, Nazi regime, etc., was popularized by German exiles abroad. From them, it spread into other languages, and eventually was brought back to Germany, after the war.” Etymology of the word Nazi: https:\/\/archive.fo\/wycc Azov Battalion: “The regiment’s first commander was far-right nationalist Andriy Biletsky, who led the neo-Nazi Social-National Assembly and Patriot of Ukraine. In its early days, Azov was the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ special police company, led by Volodymyr Shpara, the leader of the Vasylkiv, Kiev, branch of Patriot of Ukraine and Right Sector.” “Biletsky stayed out of the public spotlight working on expanding Azov to battalion size. In summer 2014, he took the command of the unit. In August 2014, he was awarded a military decoration, “Order For Courage”, by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, and promoted to lieutenant colonel of in the Interior Ministry’s police forces. Because Biletsky was elected into the Ukrainian parliament in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election he left the battalion in October 2016 (Ukrainian elected officials can not be in the military (nor police)).” “Azov has gained notoriety among its detractors due to allegations of torture and war crimes, as well as the neo-Nazi sympathies of some of its members.” “On October 18, 2008, Biletsky and other Patriot of Ukraine members were arrested during the Ukrainian Insurgent Army memorial march. In November 2008, Biletsky initiated the creation of the Social National Assembly (SNA) which included four other organizations: Spadshchyna (Heritage), Patriot of Ukraine (2005), Revolyutsiya i Derzhava (RiD, Revolution and State), and Slava i Chest (SiCh, Glory and Honor).” Azov Battalion (Wikipedia): https:\/\/archive.fo\/1SpLK “The Social-National Assembly (led by the battalion’s leader Biletsky) calls for the expansion of Ukraine, the “struggle for the liberation of the entire White Race,” and seeks to “punish severely sexual perversions and any interracial contacts”.” Azov Battalion (MilitaryWiki): https:\/\/archive.fo\/e681g “The New York Times has been more biased on the Ukraine crisis endlessly promoting State Department propaganda than when it published false Iraqi WMD stories last decade. Case in point: a story from Mariupol hailing the Azov battalion without noting its neo-Nazi fighters.” More evidence continued to emerge about the presence of Nazis in the ranks of Ukrainian government fighters. Germans were shocked to see video of Azov militia soldiers decorating their gear with the Swastika and the “SS rune.” NBC News reported: “Germans were confronted with images of their country’s dark past … when German public broadcaster ZDF showed video of Ukrainian soldiers with Nazi symbols on their helmets in its evening newscast. NYT Whites Out Ukraine’s Brown Shirts: https:\/\/archive.fo\/rVGEp “Now that the situation in Ukraine has officially been upgraded to “war”, what really happens on the ground will remain largely wrapped by the fog of war on either side, with just one thing assured: a war it may be but more than anything it is a proxy war - one in which both western and Russian interests are manifest in the fighting, and killing, of mostly innocent civilians in Ukraine - a carbon copy replica of what happened last year in Syria. The latest reminder of just this comes from AFP which reports, citing Germany’s Bild, that “dozens of specialists from the US Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation are advising the Ukrainian government.”” Dozens Of CIA, FBI Agents “Advising Ukraine Government”, German Press Reports: https:\/\/archive.fo\/iZ9sI Hillary Clinton, Alexandra Chalupa &amp; Ukraine: Alright, so what does this have to do with PropOrNot and the recent surge in propaganda? The current goverment of Ukraine which the CIA, MI6 and Mossad helped put into power are composed of OUN members and their descendants. The majority of which are OUN-B members, or followers of Bandera. In fact the major Ukrainian organizations in the US are also OUN-B, including the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). The Ukrainian-American organizations and the Ukrainian government backed Hillary Clinton this election. They also tried to sabotage Trump’s campaign by pushing the Russian spy narrative - perhaps even starting the rumor. Why? One reason is Hillary’s promise for more financial and military aid to Ukraine. Clinton urges more financial, military aid to Ukraine: https:\/\/archive.fo\/B6Jql “Politico reported that the Ukrainian Government worked to aid Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential elections. The actions taken by government officials included disseminating “documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.” “Those documents implicated Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who worked as an adviser for now-ousted Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovych. However, the concerns that the documents raised weren’t in fact over any quasi-Russian ties, though partisan reporting pushed this narrative. Rather, the documents raised the question of whether Manafort declared the income that he had received from the position. The Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta, also conducted work for Yanukovych. However, the Manafort narrative not only painted Trump as pro-Russian, but also provided the Clinton campaign with a smear campaign while reaffirming its stance against Russia.” “Politico noted that Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American working as a consultant for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), met with top Ukrainian Officials in Washington D.C. about forcing Manafort’s resignation in order to perpetuate the narrative that Trump is connected to Russia. Both Chalupa and her sister Andrea have strongly pushed the anti-Russian narrative on social media, in addition to advocating that the electors of the electoral college defect from Trump. The report added, “Politico’s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another’s elections.”” “In addition to the Chalupas, the co-founder and CTO of Crowdstrike, the cyber security firm that the DNC hired to investigate the alleged hacks, Dmitri Alperovitch, also serves as a senior fellow to the Washington-based think tank Atlantic Council, which is an openly anti-Russian organization. The Atlantic Council is funded by Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk, who also happens to be one of the most prolific donors to the Clinton Foundation. The DNC denied multiple requests from the FBI to access their servers, effectively forcing the FBI to rely on CrowdStrike’s assessment of the hacks.” “The Atlantic Council has propagated anti-Russian sentiment and advocated for bolstering NATO forces in anticipation of a military conflict between with Russia longbefore Wikileaks released emails from the DNC and Clinton Campaign Manager John Podesta. In 2013, the Atlantic Council awarded Hillary Clinton its Distinguished International Leadership Award. In 2014, the Atlantic Council hosted one of several events with former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who took over after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was removed in early 2014.”” Ukraine Tried to Tip the Electionin Clinton’s Favor: https:\/\/archive.fo\/DKDSy Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire: https:\/\/archive.fo\/85xYq “​In October of this year, Yahoo News named Chalupa one of “16 People Who Shaped the 2016 Election” for her role in pinning the DNC leaks on Russian hackers, and for making the case that the Trump campaign was under Kremlin control. “As a Democratic Party consultant and proud Ukrainian-American, Alexandra Chalupa was outraged last spring when Donald Trump named Paul Manafort as his campaign manager,” the Yahoo profile began. “As she saw it, Manafort was a key figure in advancing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda inside her ancestral homeland — and she was determined to expose it.” “In one leaked DNC email earlier this year, Chalupa boasts to DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda that she brought Isikoff to a US-government sponsored Washington event featuring 68 Ukrainian journalists, where Chalupa was invited “to speak specifically about Paul Manafort.” In turn, Isikoff named her as the key inside source “proving” that the Russians were behind the hacks, and that Trump’s campaign was under the spell of Kremlin spies and sorcerers.” “According to The Guardian, Chalupa recently sent a report to Congress proving Russian hacked into the vote count, hoping to initiate a Congressional investigation. In an interview with Gothamist, Chalupa described alleged Russian interference in the election result as “an act of war”.” Anonymous Blacklist Promoted by WaPo Has Apparent Ties to Ukrainian Fascism and CIA Spying: https:\/\/archive.fo\/ChuV5 “… a DNC consultant researching pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine lead DNC leaders to conclude the Russian government is behind such attacks.” Clinton Email Investigation Timeline, Late April 2016—Early May, 2016: https:\/\/archive.fo\/04Ubh CIA, Soros &amp; Fact-Checking: “The Atlantic Council itself is no stranger to the promotion of the Banderite (OUN-B) ideology as representing “democratic” Ukrainian nationalism.

Karatnycky and his wife, National Endowment for Democracy (NED) Vice President Nadia Diuk, worked in the 1980s in programs run through Prolog Research Corporation, the front organization set up by the CIA in 1952 as a vehicle for Banderite war criminal Mykola Lebed to continue anti-Soviet operations.

Without rousing suspicions, it has put in place the biggest network of corruption in the world, bribing trade unions and management syndicates, political parties both on both the Right and Left so that they defend the interests of the United States instead of their members.” NED, the Legal Window of the CIA: https:\/\/archive.fo\/nrJ06 NED is also funding the Poynters Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which will be doing the fact-checking for Facebook. Other funders include the Open Society Foundations (George Soros), Google, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Omidyar Network. The Poynters Institute was founded by Nelson Poynter, who was a director in the US Coordinators Office of Information (COI), which later split into the OSS and Office of War Information (OWI). “​Now more documents, in the massive 2,500 leaked tranche, show the immense power and control Soros had over Ukraine immediately following the illegal Maidan government overthrow. Soros and his NGO executives held detailed and extensive meetings with just about every actor involved in the Maidan coup…from US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, to Ukraine’s Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Health, and Education. Plans to subvert and undermine Russian influence and cultural ties to Ukraine are a central focus of every conversation.

For the last 60-70 years this agenda has also seemed to aligned with the that of the fascist Ukrainian Nationalists of the OUN-B. Along with the International Fact-Checking Network, Soros also funds several fact-checking websites in the EU. Considering the above information as well as the timing, it’s probably safe to say the CIA is behind PropOrNot. The Ukrainian Nationalists, and all the other factions mentioned are mostly likely involved directly or indirectly as well. We can also get a good idea of who is behind PropOrNot by taking a look at their list of “Russian propaganda” themes: Obama, Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel, NATO, Ukraine, Jewish people (You think they meant to say Israel?), U.S. Allies, Mainstream Media, ​​So, if you think any of the above are possibly corrupt and decide to voice your opinion, you’re spreading Russian propaganda.

It’s a war against those of us who give a damn about free speech. This isn’t an exaggeration either. These same groups were willing to kill activists and journalists in Ukraine for the exact same reasons. Ukraine now has laws making it illegal to speak ill of the government, and anti-protesting laws have also been passed. They have also passed a law making it legal for the military to shoot deserters. These are the fascists that the US, UK and Israel backed in the 2014 coup\/revolution in Ukraine. We helped put them in power. Now those same people are bringing the war to the US. Why?

	{"title":"Operation Ingsoc - Censorship", "text": "​Once again we are at a time when we’re about to lose the internet, and not just the internet but also our privacy and freedom of speech. Slowly we have witnessed more and more of our rights getting taken away. 9\/11 marked the year when we as a country decided to willingly give up our freedoms in exchange for “security”. The U.S. Government’s fear-mongering was a well-played chess move to gain more control and take away our rights. We gave them that game – hell, we handed them the whole damn chess board and said “keep it!”. Well it’s time to wake up and get back in the game because the few rights we do have left, the ones that many of us took for granted, are being stripped away, exponentially. The Executive Orders, Congressional Bills and procedural changes are passing left and right, so fast it’s hard to keep up. We try to protest one and another one slips by unnoticed. It’s time for all of us to wake up, unite and fight back! Rule 41 ​The amendment to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was quietly passed by The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules and the Supreme Court. The Department of Justice requested this “procedure” change to circumvent the need to pass a bill in Congress. If you haven’t heard of the amendment to Rule 41  Search and Seizure, here’s a brief overview from the Electronic Frontier Foundation  “The first part of this change would grant authority to practically any judge to issue a search warrant to remotely access, seize, or copy data relevant to a crime when a computer was using privacy-protective tools to safeguard one’s location. Many different commonly used tools might fall into this category. For example, people who use Tor, folks running a Tor node, or people using a VPN would certainly be implicated.” “The second part of the proposal is just as concerning. It would grant authorization to a judge to issue a search warrant for hacking, seizing, or otherwise infiltrating computers that may be part of a botnet. This means victims of malware could find themselves doubly infiltrated  their computers infected with malware and used to contribute to a botnet, and then government agents given free rein to remotely access their computers as part of the investigation.” “Make no mistake  the Rule 41 proposal implicates people well beyond U.S. borders. This update expands the jurisdiction of judges to cover any computer user in the world who is using technology to protect their location privacy or is unwittingly part of a botnet.” ​With Rule 41, Little-Known Committee Proposes to Grant New Hacking Powers to the Government  The amendment to Rule 41 became law on December 1st, 2016. Barack Obama Calls for Censorship ​White House Frontier’s Conference, Pittsburgh  Transcript of Obama’s Remarks White House Frontier’s Conference Video Clip - YouTube ​At the White House Frontiers Conference in October 2016, Obama made a statement basically saying that there needs to be “truth” filters on the internet, and hinting at the censorship that was to come. “We’re going to have to rebuild, within this Wild, Wild West of information flow, some sort of curating function that people agree to.” “But there has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world.” “And that’s hard to do, but I think it’s going to be necessary, it’s going to be possible.” ​​Anyone who’s sifted through the government’s propaganda before will easily see through this statement. Whatever they deem to be “untrue” you will not be allowed to see. They want us to all trust “a basic body of information,” you know, whatever they tell us to trust. Mike Krieger summed it up pretty well in the article, Obama Enters Media Wars  Why His Recent Attack on Free Speech is so Dangerous and Radical, posted on Zero Hedge. Obama’s use of the word “truthiness” is revealing, whether it was intentional or just a Freudian slip. If you look up the definition for “truthiness”, you’ll find that it’s a term coined by Stephen Colbert during the pilot episode of the Colbert Report. ​​“Control of the news media is an instrumental, key feature to any totalitarian government. In contrast, the primary reason this experiment known as the United States has lasted so long under relatively free conditions is due to the preservation of free speech (and press) via the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” “In case you haven’t read it in a while, here’s the text  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Nowhere in there do I see an exception for “conspiracy theories.” “He notes that there needs to be “some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard.” This sounds good on the surface because, after all, who doesn’t want truth? The problem lies in the fact that governments can and do lie all the time about stuff of monumental significance.” “My view is that there is a full on panic occurring right now at the very top of America’s shadow government due to the fact that the public is no longer falling for corporate media propaganda.” “So here’s the bottom line. 2016 represents the true beginning of what I would call the Media Wars. Alternative media is now capable of driving the news cycle. Mainstream media now has no choice but to fight back, and fight back it will. It will fight back dirty. This is going to get very ugly, but by the time the dust has settled, I think much of the mainstream media will be left as a shell of its former self.” “By ugly, I didn’t expect the President of these United States to so publicly and radically advocate in favor of free speech restrictions, but here we are.” “Who exactly is supposed to be granted the power to create such spaces and verify things as factual? We know that government lies all the time, yet when they lie, they present such falsehoods as fact. It is the duty of the people to decide what to believe and what not to believe. This is not the job of government, or anyone else for that matter.” ​Obama Enters Media Wars  Why His Recent Attack On Free Speech Is So Dangerous & Radical  Obama’s use of the word “truthiness” is revealing, whether it was intentional or just a Freudian slip. If you look up the definition for “truthiness”, you’ll find that it’s a term coined by Stephen Colbert during the pilot episode of the Colbert Report. “Truthiness is a quality characterizing a “truth” that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively “from the gut” or because it “feels right” without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts.” Truthiness Wikipedia  This perfectly describes the “truth” that the government wants us to believe, regardless of facts. It’s right because it feels right, and it feels right because they tell us it’s right. Right? Hillary Calls On Congress Hillary Clinton has made a plea to Congress to do something about this “fake” news epidemic  ​“The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year — it’s now clear the so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.” Confirming what the next step in Washington’s crackdown against the First Amendment and Free Speech will be, Clinton backed the previously noted “bipartisan legislation” that seeks to give Congress more power to respond to “foreign propaganda” coming from Russia. “It is imperative that leaders in both the private and public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives,” Clinton said. And just like that, we know that according to Hillary Clinton, the biggest threat to “American democracy and innocent lives” are a few websites that refuse to be PR tools for whatever the establishment at any given moment is.” ​​Hillary Clinton Calls For Legislation To Fight ‘Fake News’  Hillary Reemerges, Slams “Dangerous Epidemic” Of Fake News  ​Mainstream Media colluded with Hillary Clinton, her presidential campaign and the DNC to manufacture false news. They even sent people to incite violence at Trump rallies. If anyone should be labeled fake news it’s Hillary Clinton, the DNC and MSM. From The Intercept  “At times, Clinton’s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be quoted ‘on background’ and what should be described as ‘on the record.” New Email Leak Reveals Clinton Campaign’s Cozy Press Relationship  ​​Rigging the Election - Video I  Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallies  The Establishment Warns About the Dangers of Fake News ​MSM and the Obama administration are using the “fake” news narrative as an excuse to censor anti-establishment views and pass laws to censor us even more. As “fake” news has become some sort of novelty in the public spectrum, everyone has been talking about #pizzagate. Recently there was a shooting at Comet Ping Pong Pizza and the media is eating it up. They are using the shooting and #pizzagate to push the agenda that “fake” news incites terrorism and radicalizes people. The witness statements don’t match the police or media narrative. This brings the veracity of the whole event into question. Was this event staged to push the “fake news” agenda to the level of terrorism? The New York Times even had an in-depth interview with the shooter. Wonder why they didn’t do this for the Aurora shooter in Colorado? There have already been many calls for censorship and control of the internet. Now that Rule 41 has been implemented and many government officials are calling for “truth” filters we must join together like we have done before so many times before. It doesn’t matter if you think #pizzagate is real or fake. The issue at hand is freedom of speech, censorship, and internet freedom. The U.S. gov’t would rather let the FBI hack the planet, instead of investigating or at the very least question a “family” business owner about sketchy pictures on social media. An example of this hypocrisy is when an 18-year-old in Texas was arrested and sent to jail for a sarcastic comment in a Facebook post about his favorite video game. Very soon “fake” news and so called “conspiracy” news will be considered terrorist propaganda on par with ISIS. They will claim it radicalized domestic terrorists who are anti-government. Anyone who supports such propaganda will be then be detained and questioned. We must disrupt them. We must take down their sites. We must boycott mainstream media. Stop clicking on their links and viewing their pages; MSM is full of lies and fake news. How many times have CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX News, The Washington Post, and The New York Times lied and propagandized shit? This is ridiculous. We must take action. Texas Teen Facing Eight Years After Violent League of Legends Threat  Truth Filters, Fact-Checkers & Domestic Propaganda Now there are multiple companies claiming to be the voice of sanity in this “wild, wild west” of information, telling us what is real and what is “fake” news. Their sole purpose is to tell the public what to think and who to trust. Here’s the secret formula  Group A agrees with the establishment’s hypocritical narrative, so they put out real news. While Group B goes against the status quo, so of course it’s fake news and Russian propaganda. Remember, “truthiness” is a quality characterizing a “truth” that a person claims to know because it “feels right” without regard to evidence or facts. Out with the Oldspeak and in with the Newspeak. George Orwell’s “Ministry of Truth” has been built and it’s up to us to tear it down, before the people don’t even have the words to comprehend what freedom is. Groups like Snopes, PropOrNot, Rootclaim and IFCN (The International Fact-Checking Network hosted by the Poynter Institute) only exist to toe the line for the establishment. PropOrNot is especially malicious. Anything that slightly criticizes the Obama administration is put on a blacklist of “Russian propaganda” sites. It’s unknown who is behind the PropOrNot website. They use a domain proxy to hide their registration information and real IP address. There are some clues that point to CIA, Ukranian Nationalists, Koch brothers and Soros. Remember, domestic propaganda is now legal again in the U.S.. The DoJ Inspector General has also found nothing wrong with a policy that allows FBI agents to impersonate journalists. Basically, Operation Mockingbird is still in effect. ​“The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press is deeply troubled by today’s disclosure, that the FBI believes that there is a place in this country for federal agents to impersonate journalists. Such a policy can seriously damage the public’s trust in its free press and the ability of journalists to hold government accountable. We urge the Justice Department to take seriously the need for reform and the importance of protecting the integrity of the newsgathering process.” ​– David Boardman, RCFP steering committee chairman ​Some of these companies are implementing algorithms to censor or filter “fake” news. One such company is Rootclaim. They claim that their “math” is beyond any human’s comprehension and completely perfect. ​“In an era in which facts, objectivity, and truth can seem increasingly out of reach, Rootclaim empowers users to overcome humanity’s inherently fallible intuition, enabling the analysis of complicated real-world news issues in an objective, mathematically sound way.” Their “truth” algorithm is proprietary, so we have no way of knowing how it works or if there really is an algorithm at all. They are an Israeli company and their Lead Analyst, Benjamin Resnick, is a Rabbi. ​It’s possible another reason for Israel to jump on the “fake” news bandwagon is to stop the BDS movement and counter any type of criticism of Israel. Is it not enough that the United States government gives Israel $3 Billion per year in military aid, but they must now control the information flow to stop any and all dissent? Anti-BDS Legislation & Censorship The Israel Lobby is behind the unconstitutional anti-BDS legislation that has been enacted in several U.S. states. BDS stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions of Israel. Many people consider Israel to be an apartheid state. Israel has intentionally targeted and murdered Palestinian civilians, including children, stolen land and illegally occupied Palestinian territory. Israeli occupation of Palestine is a war crime under international law. But do they care? No. According to Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu, Palestine is committing genocide against the Israeli people. One look at this map will show how utterly ridiculous that statement is. BDS was created to take a stand against Israel’s war crimes and fight for Palestinian rights. ​“The Supreme Court has long held that boycotts to bring about political, economic, and social change – like boycotts for Palestinian rights – are a form of expression protected by the First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, association, and petition. The government may not condition the receipt of government benefits on the requirement that a person forgo core political speech activity. Nor can the government enact measures that chill our speech rights.” “Anti-BDS laws have been enacted in the following states  Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina. An anti-BDS executive order was signed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.” ​–Palestine Legal What to know about anti-BDS legislation  ​The Israel lobby has convinced state legislature to pass laws stating that Boycott, Divestment, & Sanctions against Israel is anti-Semitic. This movement is trying to bring to light the war crimes of the Israeli government and their horrible treatment of Palestinians, it has nothing to do with the Jewish people, culture or religion. There are many Jewish people involved in the BDS movement. It is in no way anti-Semitic. But governments are good at rhetoric, and this is the rhetoric of the Israeli government to stifle dissent. U.S. politicians are ignoring our constitutional rights to spread this narrative, and this unconstitutional legislation has been passed in several states. ​“If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you.

However, as recent articles from the corporate-owned media have shown, the “Russian propaganda” and “fake news” have both become umbrella terms for a range of opinions that are critical of the U.S. government and its policies. Now, the U.S. government has officially intervened with the passage of HR 6393, titled the “Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.” The bill, which passed on November 30th, touches on several intelligence-related issues, including managing the effects of “propaganda,” specifically that directly or indirectly funded in some way by Russia.” ​House Passes Bill Targeting Russian Propaganda and Fake News  https \/\/archive.fo\/zKN5m ​Bill H.R. 6393 reveals “Title V—Matters relating to foreign countries”, whose Section 501 calls for the government to “counter active measures by Russia to exert covert influence over people and governments.” ​H.R. 6393 reveals “Title V—Matters relating to foreign countries  https \/\/tinyurl.com\/z635xgn ​“The use of incitement is particularly interesting as this term was also used by the state of Israel to crack down on dissent on Facebook, which led to the banning of several accounts belonging to Palestinian journalists and news agencies. The term “disinformation” is also riddled with problems as the term could easily be used to censor any information that runs contrary to the government’s own narrative. “Media manipulation” and “covert broadcasting” are both sufficiently broad as to include a story that the government finds to be working against its interests. According to the bill, these “active measures,” whether their “hidden” ties to Russia are proven or not, will be investigated and “countered” by an inter-agency committee set to include appointees of the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of the Treasury among others. This committee’s main duty will be to “expose falsehoods,” though the President “may designate” other relevant duties to the group.” House Passes Bill Targeting Russian Propaganda and Fake News  https \/\/archive.fo\/zKN5m ​The recent Washington Post article is a prime example of how easy it is for any alternative news source to be labeled Russian propaganda without any proof at all. Buried in the National Defense Authorization Act (or NDAA) for 2017 that Obama recently signed into law is another propaganda law! H.R. 5081  “Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act”. Known as S. 2692  “Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016” when it was signed into law by the Senate.

Facebook has appointed the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which includes Snopes and ABC News, to decide which news is “fake”. IFCN is funded by several groups including Open Society Foundations (George Soros), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google and more. Both Google and Facebook will be banning “fake” news sites from their advertising networks. Facebook may also be using curated articles “handpicked by publishers”.

This section will deliver stories and other forms of media by sources selected by Facebook.” “It seems early partners have claimed that created content will be slipped into users’ News Feed by Facebook curators, ultimately giving this content a larger reach.” “Collections might not go as planned if some folks take issue with Facebook having direct control over what users of its platform view as news. Human curators are not perfect, and there is the likely chance of some being biased when selecting news content for millions of users to see.” Facebook Could Use Curated Articles To Fight Fake News  https \/\/archive.fo\/VzwfM ​Some chance of bias? A large corporation at the beck and call of powerful politicians and intelligence agencies choosing the news you see every day – what could go wrong? We cannot wait and hope the establishment does the right thing. We all know and have seen the lies and propaganda. Let us now come together in international solidarity to make sure that our internet does not become a form of censorship and false arrest. Using encryption or hiding an IP address should not merit someone to be arrested or hacked by a government agency. Government officials and main stream media are calling for a “solution” to the “fake” news problem. It is a slippery slope until they control and manipulate all information. We have to fight back. The Mainstream Media reports fake news all the time. They reinforce false realities. Call them the fuck out. This operation is a call to everyone. MSM is one of their most important tools to control the people. It’s time we take MSM down. Fight for free speech! An International Call ​Let us all here put away our petty differences and philosophical arguments about arbitrary situations. Let go of your religions and ideological differences for one brief moment in history. We are all human beings who live in a universe not controlled by any government. The possibilities are endless along with the social construction of reality. This is an international problem that affects all people, all races, and ethnicities. If they take our internet away we will be blind again. Our third eye will be closed once again. People will start to forget. They will go back to how things were before. Right now they don’t fully control the flow of information. Soon they will, and they’ve been working really hard to control the narrative, invade our privacy and squash dissent. This is why we must stand up together. No more petty bullshit fighting. This is something bigger than all of us. We need to realize this and let our egos go. Many of our brothers and sisters have been in prison but soon they will be free. They will come back to join us. They have used the U.S. Presidential Election to distract everyone from what they had planned all along. We cannot afford to be stagnant anymore. This is an international problem and we must all take action. But before taking action, we must research, understand the facts, know what we are fighting for and against. Reacting emotionally against your opponent will only give your opponent more leverage, and more ways to manipulate you. We must be aware that there are people co-opting our revolt and infiltrating our groups to knock us down or use us for their own ends. These people have gone through this process over and over again, country after country. They are masters of propaganda. They aren’t noobs and they won’t always be easy to recognize. Just because a person or org looks like they are fighting the same fight as us, doesn’t mean they really are. Research, find intent, follow the money, the connections, and the organizations. Those trying to bait us into a reality where everything is either\/or, and black or white, is definitely suspicious. There are more than two options and two ways of being in this world. We do not accept the two party system either. Think for yourself, always. Don’t get swept into the reactionary wave. This wave is the easiest and most likely to be co-opted and used for means you’d never expect. *Doublethink is slowly becoming the norm, and it’s this extreme division, this either\/or perspective that’s getting us there. This first release of our operation is for informational purposes. We will be releasing more information periodically on this site. The actions of this operation will be coming soon. When the time is right, we’ll need you all there. We must all stand in solidarity against the corrupt establishment and shadow elites that fund them.", "tags": "", "url": "https://opingsoc.com/research/operation_ingsoc.html"},

Throwing money at more programs to “counter fake news” to me is quite frightening. We don’t need more propaganda coming from our corrupt government, especially not geared towards U.S. citizens. We don’t need our real independent media, (the ones that actual criticize our government and try to keep them in check), shut down for being “fake news”. If you don’t think the U.S. government can use propaganda on its own citizens, take a look at the law passed in 2013 that amended the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987: Smith-Mundi Modernization Act - H.R.4310.: https:\/\/archive.fo\/9vqbq Smith–Mundi Act (Wikipedia(: https:\/\/archive.fo\/g2xAU From an article by Michael Hastings in 2012, Congressmen Seek To Lift Propaganda Ban: ​​“I just don’t want to see something this significant – whatever the pros and cons – go through without anyone noticing,” says one source on the Hill, who is disturbed by the law. According to this source, the law would allow “U.S. propaganda intended to influence foreign audiences to be used on the domestic population.” The new law would give sweeping powers to the government to push television, radio, newspaper, and social media onto the U.S. public. “It removes the protection for Americans,” says a Pentagon official who is concerned about the law. “It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.” According to this official, “senior public affairs” officers within the Department of Defense want to “get rid” of Smith-Mundt and other restrictions because it prevents information activities designed to prop up unpopular policies—like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.” Congressmen Seek To Lift Propaganda Ban (Michael Hastings): https:\/\/archive.fo\/pN2mw This amendment was slipped into the 2013 NDAA and passed into law. Why does it seem like every NDAA that passes just takes more of our rights away? The previous year’s NDAA, 2012, we saw the provisions authorizing the indefinite military detention of civilians, including U.S. citizens, without habeas corpus or due process. ​Not that the legality of using propaganda against US citizens ever mattered. In 2008, investigative journalist David Barstow published an exposé in the New York Times revealing the details of a propaganda program used by the DoD since 2002. The Pentagon military analyst program was a campaign to influence public opinion of the Iraq war by briefing retired commanders for TV and radio appearances. Many published op-eds in the New York Times, as well as other newspapers and websites. They were always presented as independent analysts, rather than the mouthpiece of the military-industrial-complex that they really were. Dining with Donald H. Rumsfeld, second from left, during his final week as secretary of defense were the retired officers Donald W. Shepperd, left, Thomas G. McInerney and Steven J. Greer, right. (Image from NYTimes)&lt;\/span&gt; ​​From Barstow’s exposé, Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon’s Hidden Hand: “Five years into the Iraq war, most details of the architecture and execution of the Pentagon’s campaign have never been disclosed. But The Times successfully sued the Defense Department to gain access to 8,000 pages of e-mail messages, transcripts and records describing years of private briefings, trips to Iraq and Guantánamo and an extensive Pentagon talking points operation. These records reveal a symbiotic relationship where the usual dividing lines between government and journalism have been obliterated. “Internal Pentagon documents repeatedly refer to the military analysts as “message force multipliers” or “surrogates” who could be counted on to deliver administration “themes and messages” to millions of Americans “in the form of their own opinions.”” ​* * * * * ​“Over time, the Pentagon recruited more than 75 retired officers, although some participated only briefly or sporadically. The largest contingent was affiliated with Fox News, followed by NBC and CNN, the other networks with 24-hour cable outlets. But analysts from CBS and ABC were included, too. Some recruits, though not on any network payroll, were influential in other ways — either because they were sought out by radio hosts, or because they often published op-ed articles or were quoted in magazines, Web sites and newspapers. At least nine of them have written op-ed articles for The Times. The group was heavily represented by men involved in the business of helping companies win military contracts. Several held senior positions with contractors that gave them direct responsibility for winning new Pentagon business. James Marks, a retired Army general and analyst for CNN from 2004 to 2007, pursued military and intelligence contracts as a senior executive with McNeil Technologies. Still others held board positions with military firms that gave them responsibility for government business. General McInerney, the Fox analyst, for example, sits on the boards of several military contractors, including Nortel Government Solutions, a supplier of communication networks.” Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon’s Hidden Hand: https:\/\/archive.fo\/HpQph ​​On the Wikipedia page for the Pentagon military analyst program it states: “On 28 April 2008, the Pentagon ended the operation. A DoD Inspector General investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the DoD.” Pentagon Military Analyst Program (Wikipedia): https:\/\/archive.fo\/EzW2Q It’s correct that the Inspector General found no wrongdoing on part of the DoD. You can read David Barstow’s follow up article on that here: Pentagon Finds No Fault in Ties to TV Analysts - David Barstow (NYTimes): https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170409062720\/http:\/www.gao.gov\/assets\/390\/386306.pdf Department of Defense-Retired Military Officers as Media Analysts - GAO Decision, Full Report, PDF​: https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170409062720\/http:\/www.gao.gov\/assets\/390\/386306.pdf Wikipedia however is not correct in saying the operation ended back in 2008. ​In 2009, Brad Jacobson and Ron Brynaert, of Raw Story, contacted DoD senior officials responsible for the program in an investigation into whether or not the operation had truly ended. Needless to say the DoD officials danced around the subject refusing to provide a yes or no answer. “A week after David Barstow’s New York Times expose on the program broke in April 2008, Whitman said the military analyst program’s suspension was only “temporary.” Reiterating at the time that he thought the program was merely a way to better inform the American public, he also said, “It’s temporarily suspended just so that we can take a look at some of the concerns.” When Raw Story asked Mr. Whitman if this program was still being run out of the Pentagon, he first replied firmly, “No, not at this point.”” Pentagon Officials Won’t Confirm Bush Propaganda Program Ended – Part 1 (Raw Story): https:\/\/archive.fo\/4Pn3s “When the military analyst program was first revealed by The New York Times in 2008, retired US Army Col. Ken Allard described it as “PSYOPS on steroids.” It turns out this was far from a casual reference. Raw Story has discovered new evidence that directly exposes this stealth media project and the activities of its participants as matching the US government’s own definition of psychological operations, or PSYOPS. The US Army Civil Affairs &amp; Psychological Operations Command fact sheet, which states that PSYOPS should be directed “to foreign audiences” only, includes the following description: “Used during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments.” Pentagon public affairs officials referred to the military analysts as “message force multipliers” in documented communications.” Pentagon Used Psychological Operation on US Public, Documents Show – Part 2 (Raw Story): https:\/\/archive.fo\/Oz0Kl The Global Engagement (Propaganda) Center: The new propaganda bill introduced in March follows on the heels of H.R. 5181: Countering Foreign Propaganda &amp; Disinformation Act of 2016, also known as S. 2692, Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016. This bill was very quietly inserted into the NDAA 2017 and signed into law by Obama in December 2016. H.R. 5181 calls for the creation of a “Center”, “to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining United States national security interests.” “Developing and disseminating fact-based narratives and analysis to counter propaganda and disinformation directed at United States allies and partners.” “$20,000,000 to support the Center and provide grants or contracts of financial support to civil society groups, journalists, nongovernmental organizations, federally funded research and development centers, private companies, or academic institutions for the following purposes: ​ (A) To support local independent media who are best placed to refute foreign disinformation and manipulation in their own communities.” H.R. 5181: Countering Foreign Propaganda &amp; Disinformation Act of 2016: https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170412170414\/http:\/\/www.publicdiplomacycouncil.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Portman-Murphy%20Counter%20Foreign%20Propaganda%20and%20Disinformation%20Act.pdf The NDAA version of this bill is basically the same, except in the NDAA the “Center” is referred to as the Global Engagement Center. ​​ So taxpayers’ money is being spent on the creation of a Ministry of Truth and bribing journalists and NGO’s to lie to us. In about 50 years we’ll probably see declassified documents on the use of propaganda on the US population and the collusion between CIA and mainstream media in 2016. In the meantime, here are newly declassified documents from 1965: Memo offers a look into the CIA’s private press pool (Muckrock): https:\/\/archive.fo\/8xlak Newly-Declassified Documents Show that CIA Worked Closely with Owners and Journalists with Many of the Largest Media Outlets (Zero Hedge): https:\/\/archive.fo\/JUapc Here’s another bill that hasn’t been passed yet: HR 6393: Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 . Slipped into this act was “Title V, Section 501: Committee to counter active measures by the Russian Federation to exert covert influence over peoples and governments”. Included in the list of “covert influence” are “media manipulation” and “disinformation”. Here we see the “fake news” narrative in action. In desperation the kleptocrats are trying to shut down the rising anti-establishment views, which are becoming more widespread as people awaken to the truth. The entire system on both sides of the nonexistent two-party wall is corrupt. ​Not only has there been very little evidence provided that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack; was there even a hack? It probably doesn’t matter either way since the neocons and neoliberals are so nostalgic for the Cold War days. Let’s call this the Third Red Scare. The push to blame Russia and “fake news” seemed to begin after Wikileaks released the Podesta emails. Instead of focusing on the corruption, lies and media collusion, the establishment and mainstream media tried to divert everyone’s attention. I’ve thought about it and honestly, I don’t give a damn if Russia hacked the DNC. The DNC are corrupt, and so are the RNC. Influence the elections? You know who influences US elections? The oligarchs, the corporations, the foreign interests that bribe our so called “representatives”. Our political system is a joke. If releasing truthful information about our corrupt politicians influenced the election, then I’m all for it! Would you really rather be kept in the dark about what’s truly happening in our government? Would you rather believe the lies and promises that you’re told by politicians when the cameras are on? Sadly there are those that would, only because they are told that’s what they want. Now those are the people truly loyal to the party. I think there was a book about that called 1984. Let’s just stop pretending already that there’s actually a two-party system, throw out the Democrat and Republican labels and just called the party Ingsoc. Who knows, maybe after this Third Red Scare they will. Who do you think will be the new “radical threats to American society”? ​Anarchists. They always have to be number one. For over a hundred years there has been a system in place to shape people’s view of Anarchists. The majority of people, when you say Anarchist, think of senseless violence and people that eat babies. Well maybe not eating babies, but you get the point. The whole “no rulers” thing is about as dangerous as you can get for a kleptocrat. If you don’t know much about Anarchism, or its history, look it up – look up Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. I’ll bet it’s not what you think it is.) The First Red Scare: Did you know the first red scare was created to stifle labor worker strikes in the early 1900’s? It was the anarchists and labor unions that got us the 8 hour work day, instead of the 12-18 hour days they were forced to work. Those “evil” anarchists wanted rights for the poor, wanted the wealthy and the corporations to stop stealing from the people that actually worked hard for this country. From: The Brief Origins of May Day – Eric Chase (IWW): “A variety of socialist organizations sprung up throughout the later half of the 19th century, ranging from political parties to choir groups. In fact, many socialists were elected into governmental office by their constituency. But again, many of these socialists were ham-strung by the political process which was so evidently controlled by big business and the bi-partisan political machine. Tens of thousands of socialists broke ranks from their parties, rebuffed the entire political process, which was seen as nothing more than protection for the wealthy, and created anarchist groups throughout the country. Literally thousands of working people embraced the ideals of anarchism, which sought to put an end to all hierarchical structures (including government), emphasized worker controlled industry, and valued direct action over the bureaucratic political process. It is inaccurate to say that labor unions were “taken over” by anarchists and socialists, but rather anarchists and socialist made up the labor unions.” “At its national convention in Chicago, held in 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (which later became the American Federation of Labor), proclaimed that “eight hours shall constitute a legal day’s labor from and after May 1, 1886.” The following year, the FOTLU, backed by many Knights of Labor locals, reiterated their proclamation stating that it would be supported by strikes and demonstrations. At first, most radicals and anarchists regarded this demand as too reformist, failing to strike “at the root of the evil.” A year before the Haymarket Massacre, Samuel Fielden pointed out in the anarchist newspaper, The Alarm, that “whether a man works eight hours a day or ten hours a day, he is still a slave.”” “Not surprisingly the entire city was prepared for mass bloodshed, reminiscent of the railroad strike a decade earlier when police and soldiers gunned down hundreds of striking workers. On May 1, 1886, more than 300,000 workers in 13,000 businesses across the United States walked off their jobs in the first May Day celebration in history. In Chicago, the epicenter for the 8-hour day agitators, 40,000 went out on strike with the anarchists in the forefront of the public’s eye. With their fiery speeches and revolutionary ideology of direct action, anarchists and anarchism became respected and embraced by the working people and despised by the capitalists.” Anarchy literally means “no rulers”. That’s why our “rulers” hate them so much. People in power will do anything to stay in power. Here’s a very basic overview of the Red Scare from Wikipedia : A “Red Scare” is the promotion of fear of a potential rise of communism or radical leftism. In the United States, the First Red Scare was about worker (socialist) revolution and political radicalism. The Second Red Scare was focused on national and foreign communists infiltrating or subverting U.S. society, the federal government, or both.” “The first Red Scare began following the Bolshevik Russian Revolution of 1917 and the intensely patriotic years of World War I as anarchist and left-wing social agitation aggravated national, social, and political tensions.” “Newspapers exacerbated those political fears into anti-foreign sentiment because varieties of radical anarchism were becoming popular as possible solutions to poverty, often by recent European immigrants (cf. hyphenated-Americans). When the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) backed several labor strikes in 1916 and 1917, the press portrayed them as “radical threats to American society” inspired by “left-wing, foreign agents provocateurs.” Those on the side of the IWW claim that the press “misrepresented legitimate labor strikes” as “crimes against society,” “conspiracies against the government,” and “plots to establish communism.” Opponents, on the other hand, saw these as an extension of the radical, anarchist foundations of the IWW, which contends that all workers should be united as a social class and that capitalism and the wage system should be abolished.” ​OH NO! A solution to poverty? Abolish the slave wage system? We must fight against such threats to the kleptocratic order of the US Empire! ​₍₍ ᕕ(´◓⌓◔)ᕗ⁾⁾ &lt;– That’s me, running to fight for my masters, the kleptocrats. LOL. Take a look at that again: “The press portrayed (labor strikes) as ‘radical threats to American society’ inspired by ‘left-wing, foreign agents provocateurs.’” Sound familiar? Why would they bother changing the playbook when it works every time? It’s working now isn’t it? Russia hacked the DNC, influenced US elections, made Hillary Clinton look bad! Sigh… It is currently the “left” screaming Red, but don’t think the “right” is innocent either. It’s the Republicans that are introducing all the censorship bills to fight Russia’s “propaganda agents”. These bills will only be used to stifle free speech and take away our First Amendment rights permanently. Just read the Washington Post’s article on PropOrNot and their list of “Russian propaganda” websites. It’s only a list of media sites that don’t lick the boots of the kleptocrats. Do you think I’m over-exaggerating? Here are ProporNot’s signs of Russian propaganda : So that’s basically criticism of: Obama, Hillary Clinton, the EU, Angela Merkel, NATO, Ukraine, Jewish People (Must be a typo, I think they meant Israel), US allies, Mainstream media, Democrats and other Lefties (the warmongering ones anyway).

{"title":"Obama's Farewell Address - The Spirit of Imperialism", "text": "Contributed by Cody Foster - The Fosterian Oeuvre. In the convoluted political milieu that begat the turn of a new year, Barack Obama remained a steadfast subject of unending criticism, debate, praise, and contempt worldwide. As the leader of one of the most powerful and influential countries in the world, this is not surprising. A widely renowned effective public speaker and comfortable orator, Obama is used to delivering speeches in front of millions and receiving feedback all over the spectrum. But on January 10th, 2017, President Obama was tasked with performing what precisely forty-three people had done before him, the Farewell Address: the symbolic transfer of power from one administration to the next, the declarative end to an eight-year legacy. Given the controversial end to an election season just months prior and the undeniably tumultuous political atmosphere that typifies an ideological switch in representative political party, many would consider this ceremonial speech an exigence befitting eloquence. Despite the endless attention given to inaugural speeches since their inception (see Leff, 2008; Browne, 2002), far littler work has been done concerning the rhetoric of the Farewell Address in the United States, or more broadly the final formal speech of any leader at the end of his\/her term. The approximately forty-five minute speech delivered by Barack Obama on January 10th to a crowd of supporters in his hometown of Chicago and to millions across the world via television and internet broadcast was an overlooked critical moment in American politics and worthy of a thorough criticism. Donald Trump, Obama’s successor, won the election just months prior while losing the popular vote, an undoubtedly surprising feat. This switch from Democrat to Republican Party rule signaled widespread and sometimes ugly debate(1), and Obama’s Farewell Address sought to do just what its name would suggest: address the nation on the state of democracy. Overall, it was an optimistic vision of democracy in the United States following a year of political uneasiness surrounding a controversial election; however, I argue that the speech is riddled with contradiction and half-measure, a ploy in the name of a globalized capitalism, and more importantly a failed attempt at a call to action in opposition of Donald Trump. ​(1) It would be a disservice to a respectable rhetorical critique to ignore my bias as a critic. Given the political nature of my object of study, I will point out that I did vote for Barack Obama in the very year that I became of age to vote and the year beginning his second term. However, I have since revised my political position and have evolved toward one much more leftist, in strong opposition to both publicly recognized political parties in the United States. As such, my critique is unique in its situation, but possibly more sympathetic towards liberalism given my former association with the Democratic Party and its slightly-more-left-than-center policy. Additionally, my critique is weighted with experience from the first few weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency. The Obama Factor: Obama’s address carried with it the usual characteristics of his oratory; poise, grace, fluency, posture, projection–all the traits of a great public speaker. In addition, the seemingly undefinable charisma, the ‘cool’ factor as one Washington Post journalist writes, that made its presence felt throughout Obama’s legacy was also apparent (Rollert, 2012). Disregarding the twenty-second stammer that initiated the speech, his delivery was seamless, calculated, and effective. The content was embedded with the presidential standard of rhetorical flourish: excessive use of repetition, inclusive language, emotional appeal, and an understandable yet robust vocabulary. This cool factor that had come to define the Obama presidency allowed him to engage the crowd in his hometown and divert just enough attention from the message, redirecting it to the performance. “The Spirit” of a Nation: The message of Barack’s speech, in the simplest of terms, is one of preserving democracy. If it weren’t for democracy, America would not be the “wealthiest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth.” It is democracy that has enabled the individual to chase the American dream, as well as strive for a common good. It is democracy that has aided positive this democracy, according to Obama, do not include uniformity of opinion, but rather a basic sense of solidarity. Democracy, the essential foundation of America, is encompassed in Obama’s metaphor of the “spirit”: …the essential spirit of this country–the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders. It is that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse–the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral; the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket. This spirit, as Obama’s words seem to indicate, is self-evident in every true American. However, there are threats to this spirit that constitute the three larger arguments of his speech, terrorism, discrimination, and partisanship: the three major threats to democracy, to the spirit of all the great American feats in history. In each of these claims, ethos, pathos, and logos appeals are made in an effort to persuade the audience of the importance of these threats and how the American public can overcome them. Terrorism: The impending doom of ISIL\/ISIS, a ‘great and growing’ terror organization, looms above the American citizen; Fox News, CNN, and the rest of corporate media outlets hardly miss a day without the mention of this Islamic terrorist group. President Obama, using this media fear-fuel to his advantage, presents an argument in support of the power of America to resist its enemies. In an appeal to credibility, Obama cites his administration as responsible for the killing of Osama Bin Laden. By acting strong and swift, he was able to stifle a warlord responsible for the death of American soldiers. In an appeal to emotion and fear, the then-President highlights the prominent terrorist group’s intention of murder, quickly followed by a reiteration of American strength in the form of a democratic constitution: ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world–unless we give up what we stand for… In an appeal to logic, the former president calls upon the American to trust in the power of the American government and military. After all, his administration has shown how we deal with terrorists. Simultaneously, he identifies an enemy in Russia and China, the second and third most powerful nations in the world. In our seeming quest to be the most protected and most powerful, it is only logical that we be fearful of other weapon-wielding nations, even those without links to former terrorist plots. It is in the best interest of the American citizen, then, to be trustful of the government in its ceaseless fight against the treachery of anti-American terrorism, and by extension, those countries our military might see as a potential threat. Discrimination: Obama’s next selection is one that seems to hit home–discrimination. Bolstered by his status as an African-American, his credibility is automatically implicit. By beginning with an emotional appeal about the state of race relations since his presidency and the plight of the transgender American, he slowly eases into another contradiction. The alienated middle-class worker, born of political mistrust is “convinced that the system is designed against them.” In a light tread around the issue of the distribution of power–after claiming earlier in the speech that the wealthy indeed pay their fair share of taxes–Obama’s logos consists of accusing the proletariat of being cynical for holding this sentiment. It is only logical for them to be convinced that the system doesn’t serve their interests, but they are misguided. ​Rather than acknowledge the inconsistencies of the system that these disenfranchised peoples are concerned with, job growth under his administration is praised as an appeal to the credibility of his stance on the issue, and the prospect that capitalism doesn’t serve the interest of the poor or underprivileged is altogether ignored. Obama effectively imparts a message that his specific interpretation of one type of discrimination is a threat to democracy. Partisanship: The last identified threat to democracy is that of partisanship, for which he uses the metaphor of the bubble. Citizens are accused of staying within their own bubble, neglecting to heed the opinions of others, and rejecting science and fact while engaging in self-confirmation bias. To begin his argument against partisanship and “excusing ethical lapses in our own party” while “pounce(ing) when the other party does the same thing”, Obama cites the example of climate change. His appeal to credibility consists of explaining his administration’s success in halving American dependence on foreign oil, doubling renewable energy, and getting the world to agree that climate change is an issue of great importance. He then eases into an appeal to emotion, discussing “our children” and how they won’t have time to debate about the existence of climate change, facing environmental disaster and climate refugees. The only logical next step is discuss what the best solution to this problem is, not deny it as a problem that exists–for that is betrayal of the spirit mentioned before. While this sounds like another great message, it is riddled again with inconsistency. By bringing up the division in American politics and then refusing to acknowledge how a Democrat-or-Republican system is specifically designed to divide a populace and force a choice between the lesser of two evils, Obama has engaged in another half-measure. Take, for example, George Washington. In his farewell address, he took the idea of a two-party system head-on, warning against “the alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism” (Bemis, 1934). In a time when democracy was upholding its potential, Washington forecasted an ugly future with an honest critique. Avoiding such dramatic truth, President Obama’s weak call to respect opposing viewpoints fell on deaf ears, especially considering the loud boos of the crowd in response to the mere mention of Republicanism. The Real Spirit of Obama’s Address: This real spirit identified by Obama is more of an order, the order imposed by Western neo-liberal capitalism. As he puts it himself, it is the “post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations but built on principles–the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion, and speech, and assembly, and an independent press.” The threat to this order, in violent and fanatical Islamic terrorism, in other societies’ disapproval of the free market, is eminent. It is the antithesis of the spirit of democracy to ignore these threats. In fact, “no one who ever threatens America will ever be safe,” and “we cannot withdraw from global fights to ‘expand rights’.” It is of the American, democratic, free-market spirit, then, to overlook the atrocities committed by your government, to seize international capital, to thwart local interests for the interest of Western liberal interpretations of basic, fundamental human rights. Because, “no matter how imperfect our efforts … that’s part of defending America.” By consistently referencing this spirit and the defense of it as the only logical option, Obama ingeniously uses this rhetorical appeal to confirm support for the American government’s interests. As Bell (2000) discusses at length in East Meets West, many societies of the Eastern world are quite wary of the influence of Western neo-liberal capitalism. For instance, Singaporean peoples are “less concerned about enacting freely-chosen life plans and more reluctant to voice their interests in the political arena.” Similarly, American-born Polish journalist Jurek Arnoldski writes extensively about the American powerhouse as one that seeks “unipolarity”–a uniformity of culture, government, and human rights conceptions, while countries in Eastern Europe and Russia seek to maintain “multipolarity”–preserving distinct ways of life without military or social influence from other domineering countries (Arnoldski, 2015). The John Locke-style universal conception of human rights and of society in general does not necessarily befit the rest of the world, and there has certainly been resistance to its influence. Obama’s assumption that the order secured after World War II is in the interest of humanity globally is in itself a contradiction to the many societies that have thrived without democracy and without the imposition of this order. Although its vision of individualism and freedom resonates with Americans, this call to restore and protect democracy is really a call to continue imposing the will of American power and American profit interest around the world. By framing the entire speech around a spirit, the intangible heart common to all Americans, Obama was able to effectively appeal to the vast majority of his audience, all the while cloaking the oligarch-to-oligarch transfer of power. The reason Obama refused to make mention of Donald Trump, the reason he treaded around subjects of income equality and partisanship, was not born of a duty to be cordial, but rather a duty to remain faithful to the corporations he had protected throughout his presidency, to the military industrial complex he kept active and thriving, to the fear of terrorism he sought to perpetuate at the expense of the American people, and to the two-party oligarchy of which he is apart. In all his grace and elegancy, his charisma and charm, his supposed respect for all creatures, Obama has failed at his last great speech. The contradictions and half-measures evident in his address provide support for his real intention. With one final chance to call to action a republic on the brink of a dismal future under a pop culture icon of a president, Obama stuck to the status quo and ignored the elephant in the room. Without even a mention of Donald Trump’s name, Obama relinquished his power to a man who would less than two weeks later seek multiple executive orders in opposition to all the work he had strived for during his administration. An exigence befitting eloquence was met instead with cowardice, acceptance of the status quo, and a refusal to give up character for vigilance in the name of the American future–veiled by rhetorical flourish and charisma. Discussion: Overall, Obama delivered a typical, positive speech to the American public about the importance of democracy. Nothing out of the ordinary, the President stuck to his manuscript and delivered in the way that he has so many times before. However, this analysis has provided support for the ineffectiveness of Obama at calling his country to action in the face of a characteristically regressive Donald Trump presidency, but also the effectiveness of his rhetoric in obscuring the real aim of his speech. By using a frame atypical of two-party American politics, I was able to unpack the rhetoric of Obama’s address as a ploy for not the celebration of democracy but the subversion of the working class in the interest of the elite; the alienation of system cynicism as a threat to Western liberalism, and by extension, a threat to the large and powerful oligarchs who profit from such a system. A thorough critique of the often-ignored Farewell Address, accompanied by an account of personal bias and context, provided this paper with a unique contribution to the study of this rhetorical artifact and artifacts of its type.", "tags": "", "url": "https://opingsoc.github.io/research/obamas_farewell.html"}
