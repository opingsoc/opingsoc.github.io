	{"title":"Operation Ingsoc - Censorship", "text": "​Once again we are at a time when we’re about to lose the internet, and not just the internet but also our privacy and freedom of speech. Slowly we have witnessed more and more of our rights getting taken away. 9\/11 marked the year when we as a country decided to willingly give up our freedoms in exchange for “security”. The U.S. Government’s fear-mongering was a well-played chess move to gain more control and take away our rights. We gave them that game – hell, we handed them the whole damn chess board and said “keep it!”. Well it’s time to wake up and get back in the game because the few rights we do have left, the ones that many of us took for granted, are being stripped away, exponentially. The Executive Orders, Congressional Bills and procedural changes are passing left and right, so fast it’s hard to keep up. We try to protest one and another one slips by unnoticed. It’s time for all of us to wake up, unite and fight back! Rule 41 ​The amendment to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was quietly passed by The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules and the Supreme Court. The Department of Justice requested this “procedure” change to circumvent the need to pass a bill in Congress. If you haven’t heard of the amendment to Rule 41: Search and Seizure, here’s a brief overview from the Electronic Frontier Foundation: “The first part of this change would grant authority to practically any judge to issue a search warrant to remotely access, seize, or copy data relevant to a crime when a computer was using privacy-protective tools to safeguard one’s location. Many different commonly used tools might fall into this category. For example, people who use Tor, folks running a Tor node, or people using a VPN would certainly be implicated.” “The second part of the proposal is just as concerning. It would grant authorization to a judge to issue a search warrant for hacking, seizing, or otherwise infiltrating computers that may be part of a botnet. This means victims of malware could find themselves doubly infiltrated: their computers infected with malware and used to contribute to a botnet, and then government agents given free rein to remotely access their computers as part of the investigation.” “Make no mistake: the Rule 41 proposal implicates people well beyond U.S. borders. This update expands the jurisdiction of judges to cover any computer user in the world who is using technology to protect their location privacy or is unwittingly part of a botnet.” ​With Rule 41, Little-Known Committee Proposes to Grant New Hacking Powers to the Government: https:\/\/archive.fo\/Ophob The amendment to Rule 41 became law on December 1st, 2016. Barack Obama Calls for Censorship ​White House Frontier’s Conference, Pittsburgh: Transcript of Obama’s Remarks White House Frontier’s Conference Video Clip - YouTube ​At the White House Frontiers Conference in October 2016, Obama made a statement basically saying that there needs to be “truth” filters on the internet, and hinting at the censorship that was to come. “We’re going to have to rebuild, within this Wild, Wild West of information flow, some sort of curating function that people agree to.” “But there has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world.” “And that’s hard to do, but I think it’s going to be necessary, it’s going to be possible.” ​​Anyone who’s sifted through the government’s propaganda before will easily see through this statement. Whatever they deem to be “untrue” you will not be allowed to see. They want us to all trust “a basic body of information,” you know, whatever they tell us to trust. Mike Krieger summed it up pretty well in the article, Obama Enters Media Wars: Why His Recent Attack on Free Speech is so Dangerous and Radical, posted on Zero Hedge. Obama’s use of the word “truthiness” is revealing, whether it was intentional or just a Freudian slip. If you look up the definition for “truthiness”, you’ll find that it’s a term coined by Stephen Colbert during the pilot episode of the Colbert Report. ​​“Control of the news media is an instrumental, key feature to any totalitarian government. In contrast, the primary reason this experiment known as the United States has lasted so long under relatively free conditions is due to the preservation of free speech (and press) via the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” “In case you haven’t read it in a while, here’s the text: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Nowhere in there do I see an exception for “conspiracy theories.” “He notes that there needs to be “some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard.” This sounds good on the surface because, after all, who doesn’t want truth? The problem lies in the fact that governments can and do lie all the time about stuff of monumental significance.” “My view is that there is a full on panic occurring right now at the very top of America’s shadow government due to the fact that the public is no longer falling for corporate media propaganda.” “So here’s the bottom line. 2016 represents the true beginning of what I would call the Media Wars. Alternative media is now capable of driving the news cycle. Mainstream media now has no choice but to fight back, and fight back it will. It will fight back dirty. This is going to get very ugly, but by the time the dust has settled, I think much of the mainstream media will be left as a shell of its former self.” “By ugly, I didn’t expect the President of these United States to so publicly and radically advocate in favor of free speech restrictions, but here we are.” “Who exactly is supposed to be granted the power to create such spaces and verify things as factual? We know that government lies all the time, yet when they lie, they present such falsehoods as fact. It is the duty of the people to decide what to believe and what not to believe. This is not the job of government, or anyone else for that matter.” ​Obama Enters Media Wars: Why His Recent Attack On Free Speech Is So Dangerous & Radical: https:\/\/archive.is\/hJfQJ Obama’s use of the word “truthiness” is revealing, whether it was intentional or just a Freudian slip. If you look up the definition for “truthiness”, you’ll find that it’s a term coined by Stephen Colbert during the pilot episode of the Colbert Report. “Truthiness is a quality characterizing a “truth” that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively “from the gut” or because it “feels right” without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts.” Truthiness [Wikipedia]: https:\/\/archive.fo\/noMyi This perfectly describes the “truth” that the government wants us to believe, regardless of facts. It’s right because it feels right, and it feels right because they tell us it’s right. Right? Hillary Calls On Congress Hillary Clinton has made a plea to Congress to do something about this “fake” news epidemic: ​“The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year — it’s now clear the so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.” Confirming what the next step in Washington’s crackdown against the First Amendment and Free Speech will be, Clinton backed the previously noted “bipartisan legislation” that seeks to give Congress more power to respond to “foreign propaganda” coming from Russia. “It is imperative that leaders in both the private and public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives,” Clinton said. And just like that, we know that according to Hillary Clinton, the biggest threat to “American democracy and innocent lives” are a few websites that refuse to be PR tools for whatever the establishment at any given moment is.” ​​Hillary Clinton Calls For Legislation To Fight ‘Fake News’: https:\/\/archive.fo\/noMyi Hillary Reemerges, Slams “Dangerous Epidemic” Of Fake News: https:\/\/archive.fo\/lOrjv ​Mainstream Media colluded with Hillary Clinton, her presidential campaign and the DNC to manufacture false news. They even sent people to incite violence at Trump rallies. If anyone should be labeled fake news it’s Hillary Clinton, the DNC and MSM. From The Intercept: “At times, Clinton’s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be quoted ‘on background’ and what should be described as ‘on the record.” New Email Leak Reveals Clinton Campaign’s Cozy Press Relationship: https:\/\/archive.fo\/UqGVi ​​Rigging the Election - Video I: Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallies: https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/jc2ctju The Establishment Warns About the Dangers of Fake News ​MSM and the Obama administration are using the “fake” news narrative as an excuse to censor anti-establishment views and pass laws to censor us even more. As “fake” news has become some sort of novelty in the public spectrum, everyone has been talking about #pizzagate. Recently there was a shooting at Comet Ping Pong Pizza and the media is eating it up. They are using the shooting and #pizzagate to push the agenda that “fake” news incites terrorism and radicalizes people. The witness statements don’t match the police or media narrative. This brings the veracity of the whole event into question. Was this event staged to push the “fake news” agenda to the level of terrorism? The New York Times even had an in-depth interview with the shooter. Wonder why they didn’t do this for the Aurora shooter in Colorado? There have already been many calls for censorship and control of the internet. Now that Rule 41 has been implemented and many government officials are calling for “truth” filters we must join together like we have done before so many times before. It doesn’t matter if you think #pizzagate is real or fake. The issue at hand is freedom of speech, censorship, and internet freedom. The U.S. gov’t would rather let the FBI hack the planet, instead of investigating or at the very least question a “family” business owner about sketchy pictures on social media. An example of this hypocrisy is when an 18-year-old in Texas was arrested and sent to jail for a sarcastic comment in a Facebook post about his favorite video game. Very soon “fake” news and so called “conspiracy” news will be considered terrorist propaganda on par with ISIS. They will claim it radicalized domestic terrorists who are anti-government. Anyone who supports such propaganda will be then be detained and questioned. We must disrupt them. We must take down their sites. We must boycott mainstream media. Stop clicking on their links and viewing their pages; MSM is full of lies and fake news. How many times have CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX News, The Washington Post, and The New York Times lied and propagandized shit? This is ridiculous. We must take action. Texas Teen Facing Eight Years After Violent League of Legends Threat: https:\/\/archive.fo\/Tkban Truth Filters, Fact-Checkers & Domestic Propaganda Now there are multiple companies claiming to be the voice of sanity in this “wild, wild west” of information, telling us what is real and what is “fake” news. Their sole purpose is to tell the public what to think and who to trust. Here’s the secret formula: Group A agrees with the establishment’s hypocritical narrative, so they put out real news. While Group B goes against the status quo, so of course it’s fake news and Russian propaganda. Remember, “truthiness” is a quality characterizing a “truth” that a person claims to know because it “feels right” without regard to evidence or facts. Out with the Oldspeak and in with the Newspeak. George Orwell’s “Ministry of Truth” has been built and it’s up to us to tear it down, before the people don’t even have the words to comprehend what freedom is. Groups like Snopes, PropOrNot, Rootclaim and IFCN (The International Fact-Checking Network hosted by the Poynter Institute) only exist to toe the line for the establishment. PropOrNot is especially malicious. Anything that slightly criticizes the Obama administration is put on a blacklist of “Russian propaganda” sites. It’s unknown who is behind the PropOrNot website. They use a domain proxy to hide their registration information and real IP address. There are some clues that point to CIA, Ukranian Nationalists, Koch brothers and Soros. Remember, domestic propaganda is now legal again in the U.S.. The DoJ Inspector General has also found nothing wrong with a policy that allows FBI agents to impersonate journalists. Basically, Operation Mockingbird is still in effect. ​“The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press is deeply troubled by today’s disclosure, that the FBI believes that there is a place in this country for federal agents to impersonate journalists. Such a policy can seriously damage the public’s trust in its free press and the ability of journalists to hold government accountable. We urge the Justice Department to take seriously the need for reform and the importance of protecting the integrity of the newsgathering process.” ​– David Boardman, RCFP steering committee chairman ​Some of these companies are implementing algorithms to censor or filter “fake” news. One such company is Rootclaim. They claim that their “math” is beyond any human’s comprehension and completely perfect. ​“In an era in which facts, objectivity, and truth can seem increasingly out of reach, Rootclaim empowers users to overcome humanity’s inherently fallible intuition, enabling the analysis of complicated real-world news issues in an objective, mathematically sound way.” Their “truth” algorithm is proprietary, so we have no way of knowing how it works or if there really is an algorithm at all. They are an Israeli company and their Lead Analyst, Benjamin Resnick, is a Rabbi. ​It’s possible another reason for Israel to jump on the “fake” news bandwagon is to stop the BDS movement and counter any type of criticism of Israel. Is it not enough that the United States government gives Israel $3 Billion per year in military aid, but they must now control the information flow to stop any and all dissent? Anti-BDS Legislation & Censorship The Israel Lobby is behind the unconstitutional anti-BDS legislation that has been enacted in several U.S. states. BDS stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions of Israel. Many people consider Israel to be an apartheid state. Israel has intentionally targeted and murdered Palestinian civilians, including children, stolen land and illegally occupied Palestinian territory. Israeli occupation of Palestine is a war crime under international law. But do they care? No. According to Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu, Palestine is committing genocide against the Israeli people. One look at this map will show how utterly ridiculous that statement is. BDS was created to take a stand against Israel’s war crimes and fight for Palestinian rights. ​“The Supreme Court has long held that boycotts to bring about political, economic, and social change – like boycotts for Palestinian rights – are a form of expression protected by the First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, association, and petition. The government may not condition the receipt of government benefits on the requirement that a person forgo core political speech activity. Nor can the government enact measures that chill our speech rights.” “Anti-BDS laws have been enacted in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina. An anti-BDS executive order was signed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.” ​–Palestine Legal What to know about anti-BDS legislation: http:\/\/palestinelegal.org\/news\/2016\/6\/3\/what-to-know-about-anti-bds-legislation ​The Israel lobby has convinced state legislature to pass laws stating that Boycott, Divestment, & Sanctions against Israel is anti-Semitic. This movement is trying to bring to light the war crimes of the Israeli government and their horrible treatment of Palestinians, it has nothing to do with the Jewish people, culture or religion. There are many Jewish people involved in the BDS movement. It is in no way anti-Semitic. But governments are good at rhetoric, and this is the rhetoric of the Israeli government to stifle dissent. U.S. politicians are ignoring our constitutional rights to spread this narrative, and this unconstitutional legislation has been passed in several states. ​“If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you. If you divert revenues from Israel, New York will divert revenues from you. If you sanction Israel, New York will sanction you. Period.” New York Blacklist Revives Mccarthy Tactics: https:\/\/archive.fo\/mdPqc ​Boycotting is protected by the First Amendment. Also, according to the Supreme Court spending money is considered a form of free speech and corporations are people. If this is true States should not be able to blacklist companies that are boycotting Israel in protest of their war crimes. Freedom of Information Request Reveals Pro-Israel Lobbying Push Behind Gov. Cuomo’s Disturbing BDS Blacklist: https:\/\/archive.fo\/lOZTy ​How Spending Money Became a Form of Speech: https:\/\/archive.fo\/gN1ge H.R. 6393, 5181, NDAA & So Called Russian Propaganda “Since the U.S. election concluded, “fake news” and “Russian propaganda” have become commonly cited by Clinton supporters and parroted by the corporate media as the scapegoat for Trump’s “shocking” victory. However, as recent articles from the corporate-owned media have shown, the “Russian propaganda” and “fake news” have both become umbrella terms for a range of opinions that are critical of the U.S. government and its policies. Now, the U.S. government has officially intervened with the passage of HR 6393, titled the “Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.” The bill, which passed on November 30th, touches on several intelligence-related issues, including managing the effects of “propaganda,” specifically that directly or indirectly funded in some way by Russia.” ​House Passes Bill Targeting Russian Propaganda and Fake News: https:\/\/archive.fo\/zKN5m ​Bill H.R. 6393 reveals “Title V—Matters relating to foreign countries”, whose Section 501 calls for the government to “counter active measures by Russia to exert covert influence over people and governments.” ​H.R. 6393 reveals “Title V—Matters relating to foreign countries: https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/z635xgn ​“The use of incitement is particularly interesting as this term was also used by the state of Israel to crack down on dissent on Facebook, which led to the banning of several accounts belonging to Palestinian journalists and news agencies. The term “disinformation” is also riddled with problems as the term could easily be used to censor any information that runs contrary to the government’s own narrative. “Media manipulation” and “covert broadcasting” are both sufficiently broad as to include a story that the government finds to be working against its interests. According to the bill, these “active measures,” whether their “hidden” ties to Russia are proven or not, will be investigated and “countered” by an inter-agency committee set to include appointees of the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of the Treasury among others. This committee’s main duty will be to “expose falsehoods,” though the President “may designate” other relevant duties to the group.” House Passes Bill Targeting Russian Propaganda and Fake News: https:\/\/archive.fo\/zKN5m ​The recent Washington Post article is a prime example of how easy it is for any alternative news source to be labeled Russian propaganda without any proof at all. Buried in the National Defense Authorization Act (or NDAA) for 2017 that Obama recently signed into law is another propaganda law! H.R. 5081: “Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act”. Known as S. 2692: “Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016” when it was signed into law by the Senate. This law approves funding for a new propaganda agency called the “Global Engagement Center” which will be managed by the Secretary of State. Our own “Ministry of Propaganda”– or “Ministry of Truth”. Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election, experts say[Washington Post]: https:\/\/archive.fo\/DnEgL Don’t forget: 2 + 2 = 5 Social Media’s Fight Against Fake News Twitter and Facebook already have filters or algorithms in place to shadow ban people and censor us for talking about things that go against what they consider to be socially acceptable. Facebook has appointed the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which includes Snopes and ABC News, to decide which news is “fake”. IFCN is funded by several groups including Open Society Foundations (George Soros), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google and more. Both Google and Facebook will be banning “fake” news sites from their advertising networks. Facebook may also be using curated articles “handpicked by publishers”. About the International Fact-Checking Network (and Funders): https:\/\/archive.fo\/zbHV1 ​Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from their advertising networks: https:\/\/archive.fo\/FI3T8 ​“These curated articles will be placed in a section on the social platform known as Collections. This section will deliver stories and other forms of media by sources selected by Facebook.” “It seems early partners have claimed that created content will be slipped into users’ News Feed by Facebook curators, ultimately giving this content a larger reach.” “Collections might not go as planned if some folks take issue with Facebook having direct control over what users of its platform view as news. Human curators are not perfect, and there is the likely chance of some being biased when selecting news content for millions of users to see.” Facebook Could Use Curated Articles To Fight Fake News: https:\/\/archive.fo\/VzwfM ​Some chance of bias? A large corporation at the beck and call of powerful politicians and intelligence agencies choosing the news you see every day – what could go wrong? We cannot wait and hope the establishment does the right thing. We all know and have seen the lies and propaganda. Let us now come together in international solidarity to make sure that our internet does not become a form of censorship and false arrest. Using encryption or hiding an IP address should not merit someone to be arrested or hacked by a government agency. Government officials and main stream media are calling for a “solution” to the “fake” news problem. It is a slippery slope until they control and manipulate all information. We have to fight back. The Mainstream Media reports fake news all the time. They reinforce false realities. Call them the fuck out. This operation is a call to everyone. MSM is one of their most important tools to control the people. It’s time we take MSM down. Fight for free speech! An International Call ​Let us all here put away our petty differences and philosophical arguments about arbitrary situations. Let go of your religions and ideological differences for one brief moment in history. We are all human beings who live in a universe not controlled by any government. The possibilities are endless along with the social construction of reality. This is an international problem that affects all people, all races, and ethnicities. If they take our internet away we will be blind again. Our third eye will be closed once again. People will start to forget. They will go back to how things were before. Right now they don’t fully control the flow of information. Soon they will, and they’ve been working really hard to control the narrative, invade our privacy and squash dissent. This is why we must stand up together. No more petty bullshit fighting. This is something bigger than all of us. We need to realize this and let our egos go. Many of our brothers and sisters have been in prison but soon they will be free. They will come back to join us. They have used the U.S. Presidential Election to distract everyone from what they had planned all along. We cannot afford to be stagnant anymore. This is an international problem and we must all take action. But before taking action, we must research, understand the facts, know what we are fighting for and against. Reacting emotionally against your opponent will only give your opponent more leverage, and more ways to manipulate you. We must be aware that there are people co-opting our revolt and infiltrating our groups to knock us down or use us for their own ends. These people have gone through this process over and over again, country after country. They are masters of propaganda. They aren’t noobs and they won’t always be easy to recognize. Just because a person or org looks like they are fighting the same fight as us, doesn’t mean they really are. Research, find intent, follow the money, the connections, and the organizations. Those trying to bait us into a reality where everything is either\/or, and black or white, is definitely suspicious. There are more than two options and two ways of being in this world. We do not accept the two party system either. Think for yourself, always. Don’t get swept into the reactionary wave. This wave is the easiest and most likely to be co-opted and used for means you’d never expect. *Doublethink is slowly becoming the norm, and it’s this extreme division, this either\/or perspective that’s getting us there. This first release of our operation is for informational purposes. We will be releasing more information periodically on this site. The actions of this operation will be coming soon. When the time is right, we’ll need you all there. We must all stand in solidarity against the corrupt establishment and shadow elites that fund them.", "tags": "", "url": "https://opingsoc.github.io/research/operation_ingsoc.html"}
