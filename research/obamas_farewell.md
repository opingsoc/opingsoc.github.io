In the convoluted political milieu that begat the turn of a new year, Barack Obama remained a steadfast subject of unending criticism, debate, praise, and contempt worldwide. As the leader of one of the most powerful and influential countries in the world, this is not surprising. A widely renowned effective public speaker and comfortable orator, Obama is used to delivering speeches in front of millions and receiving feedback all over the spectrum. But on January 10th, 2017, President Obama was tasked with performing what precisely forty-three people had done before him, the Farewell Address: the symbolic transfer of power from one administration to the next, the declarative end to an eight-year legacy. Given the controversial end to an election season just months prior and the undeniably tumultuous political atmosphere that typifies an ideological switch in representative political party, many would consider this ceremonial speech an exigence befitting eloquence.

Despite the endless attention given to inaugural speeches since their inception (see Leff, 2008; Browne, 2002), far littler work has been done concerning the rhetoric of the Farewell Address in the United States, or more broadly the final formal speech of any leader at the end of his/her term. The approximately forty-five minute speech delivered by Barack Obama on January 10th to a crowd of supporters in his hometown of Chicago and to millions across the world via television and internet broadcast was an overlooked critical moment in American politics and worthy of a thorough criticism. Donald Trump, Obama’s successor, won the election just months prior while losing the popular vote, an undoubtedly surprising feat. This switch from Democrat to Republican Party rule signaled widespread and sometimes ugly debate[1], and Obama’s Farewell Address sought to do just what its name would suggest: address the nation on the state of democracy. Overall, it was an optimistic vision of democracy in the United States following a year of political uneasiness surrounding a controversial election; however, I argue that the speech is riddled with contradiction and half-measure, a ploy in the name of a globalized capitalism, and more importantly a failed attempt at a call to action in opposition of Donald Trump.

​[1] It would be a disservice to a respectable rhetorical critique to ignore my bias as a critic. Given the political nature of my object of study, I will point out that I did vote for Barack Obama in the very year that I became of age to vote and the year beginning his second term. However, I have since revised my political position and have evolved toward one much more leftist, in strong opposition to both publicly recognized political parties in the United States. As such, my critique is unique in its situation, but possibly more sympathetic towards liberalism given my former association with the Democratic Party and its slightly-more-left-than-center policy. Additionally, my critique is weighted with experience from the first few weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency.


# <a name="obama-factor"></a>The Obama Factor  
  
Obama’s address carried with it the usual characteristics of his oratory; poise, grace, fluency, posture, projection–all the traits of a great public speaker. In addition, the seemingly undefinable charisma, the ‘cool’ factor as one Washington Post journalist writes, that made its presence felt throughout Obama’s legacy was also apparent (Rollert, 2012). Disregarding the twenty-second stammer that initiated the speech, his delivery was seamless, calculated, and effective. The content was embedded with the presidential standard of rhetorical flourish: excessive use of repetition, inclusive language, emotional appeal, and an understandable yet robust vocabulary. This cool factor that had come to define the Obama presidency allowed him to engage the crowd in his hometown and divert just enough attention from the message, redirecting it to the performance.


# <a name="spirit-nation"></a>“The Spirit” of a Nation  
  
The message of Barack’s speech, in the simplest of terms, is one of preserving democracy. If it weren’t for democracy, America would not be the “wealthiest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth.” It is democracy that has enabled the individual to chase the American dream, as well as strive for a common good. It is democracy that has aided positive this democracy, according to Obama, do not include uniformity of opinion, but rather a basic sense of solidarity. Democracy, the essential foundation of America, is encompassed in Obama’s metaphor of the “spirit”:

…the essential spirit of this country–the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders. It is that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse–the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral; the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket.

This spirit, as Obama’s words seem to indicate, is self-evident in every true American. However, there are threats to this spirit that constitute the three larger arguments of his speech, terrorism, discrimination, and partisanship: the three major threats to democracy, to the spirit of all the great American feats in history. In each of these claims, ethos, pathos, and logos appeals are made in an effort to persuade the audience of the importance of these threats and how the American public can overcome them.


# <a name="terrorism"></a>Terrorism  
  
The impending doom of ISIL/ISIS, a ‘great and growing’ terror organization, looms above the American citizen; Fox News, CNN, and the rest of corporate media outlets hardly miss a day without the mention of this Islamic terrorist group. President Obama, using this media fear-fuel to his advantage, presents an argument in support of the power of America to resist its enemies. In an appeal to credibility, Obama cites his administration as responsible for the killing of Osama Bin Laden. By acting strong and swift, he was able to stifle a warlord responsible for the death of American soldiers. In an appeal to emotion and fear, the then-President highlights the prominent terrorist group’s intention of murder, quickly followed by a reiteration of American strength in the form of a democratic constitution:

 ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world–unless we give up what we stand for…

In an appeal to logic, the former president calls upon the American to trust in the power of the American government and military. After all, his administration has shown how we deal with terrorists. Simultaneously, he identifies an enemy in Russia and China, the second and third most powerful nations in the world. In our seeming quest to be the most protected and most powerful, it is only logical that we be fearful of other weapon-wielding nations, even those without links to former terrorist plots. It is in the best interest of the American citizen, then, to be trustful of the government in its ceaseless fight against the treachery of anti-American terrorism, and by extension, those countries our military might see as a potential threat.


# <a name="discrimination"></a>Discrimination  
  
Obama’s next selection is one that seems to hit home–discrimination. Bolstered by his status as an African-American, his credibility is automatically implicit. By beginning with an emotional appeal about the state of race relations since his presidency and the plight of the transgender American, he slowly eases into another contradiction. The alienated middle-class worker, born of political mistrust is “convinced that the system is designed against them.” In a light tread around the issue of the distribution of power–after claiming earlier in the speech that the wealthy indeed pay their fair share of taxes–Obama’s logos consists of accusing the proletariat of being cynical for holding this sentiment. It is only logical for them to be convinced that the system doesn’t serve their interests, but they are misguided.

​Rather than acknowledge the inconsistencies of the system that these disenfranchised peoples are concerned with, job growth under his administration is praised as an appeal to the credibility of his stance on the issue, and the prospect that capitalism doesn’t serve the interest of the poor or underprivileged is altogether ignored. Obama effectively imparts a message that his specific interpretation of one type of discrimination is a threat to democracy.


# <a name="partisanship"></a>Partisanship  
  
The last identified threat to democracy is that of partisanship, for which he uses the metaphor of the bubble. Citizens are accused of staying within their own bubble, neglecting to heed the opinions of others, and rejecting science and fact while engaging in self-confirmation bias. To begin his argument against partisanship and “excusing ethical lapses in our own party” while “pounce[ing] when the other party does the same thing”, Obama cites the example of climate change. His appeal to credibility consists of explaining his administration’s success in halving American dependence on foreign oil, doubling renewable energy, and getting the world to agree that climate change is an issue of great importance. He then eases into an appeal to emotion, discussing “our children” and how they won’t have time to debate about the existence of climate change, facing environmental disaster and climate refugees. The only logical next step is discuss what the best solution to this problem is, not deny it as a problem that exists–for that is betrayal of the spirit mentioned before.

While this sounds like another great message, it is riddled again with inconsistency. By bringing up the division in American politics and then refusing to acknowledge how a Democrat-or-Republican system is specifically designed to divide a populace and force a choice between the lesser of two evils, Obama has engaged in another half-measure. Take, for example, George Washington. In his farewell address, he took the idea of a two-party system head-on, warning against “the alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism" (Bemis, 1934). In a time when democracy was upholding its potential, Washington forecasted an ugly future with an honest critique. Avoiding such dramatic truth, President Obama’s weak call to respect opposing viewpoints fell on deaf ears, especially considering the loud boos of the crowd in response to the mere mention of Republicanism.  
  
# <a name="real-spirit"></a>The Real Spirit of Obama’s Address  
  
<div class="smallimg"><img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/published/98242-slab.png?1490229196" alt="image:oligarchy"></div>  
  
This real spirit identified by Obama is more of an order, the order imposed by Western neo-liberal capitalism. As he puts it himself, it is the “post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations but built on principles–the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion, and speech, and assembly, and an independent press.” The threat to this order, in violent and fanatical Islamic terrorism, in other societies’ disapproval of the free market, is eminent. It is the antithesis of the spirit of democracy to ignore these threats. In fact, “no one who ever threatens America will ever be safe,” and “we cannot withdraw from global fights to ‘expand rights’.” It is of the American, democratic, free-market spirit, then, to overlook the atrocities committed by your government, to seize international capital, to thwart local interests for the interest of Western liberal interpretations of basic, fundamental human rights. Because, “no matter how imperfect our efforts … that’s part of defending America.” By consistently referencing this spirit and the defense of it as the only logical option, Obama ingeniously uses this rhetorical appeal to confirm support for the American government’s interests.

As Bell (2000) discusses at length in East Meets West, many societies of the Eastern world are quite wary of the influence of Western neo-liberal capitalism. For instance, Singaporean peoples are “less concerned about enacting freely-chosen life plans and more reluctant to voice their interests in the political arena.” Similarly, American-born Polish journalist Jurek Arnoldski writes extensively about the American powerhouse as one that seeks “unipolarity”–a uniformity of culture, government, and human rights conceptions, while countries in Eastern Europe and Russia seek to maintain “multipolarity”–preserving distinct ways of life without military or social influence from other domineering countries (Arnoldski, 2015). The John Locke-style universal conception of human rights and of society in general does not necessarily befit the rest of the world, and there has certainly been resistance to its influence. Obama’s assumption that the order secured after World War II is in the interest of humanity globally is in itself a contradiction to the many societies that have thrived without democracy and without the imposition of this order. Although its vision of individualism and freedom resonates with Americans, this call to restore and protect democracy is really a call to continue imposing the will of American power and American profit interest around the world.

By framing the entire speech around a spirit, the intangible heart common to all Americans, Obama was able to effectively appeal to the vast majority of his audience, all the while cloaking the oligarch-to-oligarch transfer of power. The reason Obama refused to make mention of Donald Trump, the reason he treaded around subjects of income equality and partisanship, was not born of a duty to be cordial, but rather a duty to remain faithful to the corporations he had protected throughout his presidency, to the military industrial complex he kept active and thriving, to the fear of terrorism he sought to perpetuate at the expense of the American people, and to the two-party oligarchy of which he is apart. In all his grace and elegancy, his charisma and charm, his supposed respect for all creatures, Obama has failed at his last great speech. The contradictions and half-measures evident in his address provide support for his real intention. With one final chance to call to action a republic on the brink of a dismal future under a pop culture icon of a president, Obama stuck to the status quo and ignored the elephant in the room. Without even a mention of Donald Trump’s name, Obama relinquished his power to a man who would less than two weeks later seek multiple executive orders in opposition to all the work he had strived for during his administration. An exigence befitting eloquence was met instead with cowardice, acceptance of the status quo, and a refusal to give up character for vigilance in the name of the American future–veiled by rhetorical flourish and charisma.

# <a name="discussion"></a>Discussion  
  
Overall, Obama delivered a typical, positive speech to the American public about the importance of democracy. Nothing out of the ordinary, the President stuck to his manuscript and delivered in the way that he has so many times before. However, this analysis has provided support for the ineffectiveness of Obama at calling his country to action in the face of a characteristically regressive Donald Trump presidency, but also the effectiveness of his rhetoric in obscuring the real aim of his speech. By using a frame atypical of two-party American politics, I was able to unpack the rhetoric of Obama’s address as a ploy for not the celebration of democracy but the subversion of the working class in the interest of the elite; the alienation of system cynicism as a threat to Western liberalism, and by extension, a threat to the large and powerful oligarchs who profit from such a system. A thorough critique of the often-ignored Farewell Address, accompanied by an account of personal bias and context, provided this paper with a unique contribution to the study of this rhetorical artifact and artifacts of its type.
