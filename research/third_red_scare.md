<a href="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/published/current-truth-dark.png" class="lightbox_trigger"><img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/published/current-truth-dark.png" alt="image: The current truth announcement.

Mainstream media and “nonpartisan” think tanks already have a history of collusion with the government. Throwing money at more programs to “counter fake news” to me is quite frightening. We don’t need more propaganda coming from our corrupt government, especially not geared towards U.S. citizens. We don’t need our real independent media, (the ones that actual criticize our government and try to keep them in check), shut down for being “fake news”.
 
If you don’t think the U.S. government can use propaganda on its own citizens, take a look at the law passed in 2013 that amended the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987:

* <span class="ref">Smith-Mundi Modernization Act - H.R.4310.: <https://archive.fo/9vqbq></span>  
* <span class="ref">Smith–Mundi Act (Wikipedia(: <https://archive.fo/g2xAU></span>

From an article by Michael Hastings in 2012, Congressmen Seek To Lift Propaganda Ban:  
>​​“I just don’t want to see something this significant – whatever the pros and cons – go through without anyone noticing,” says one source on the Hill, who is disturbed by the law. According to this source, the law would allow “U.S. propaganda intended to influence foreign audiences to be used on the domestic population.”
> 
>The new law would give sweeping powers to the government to push television, radio, newspaper, and social media onto the U.S. public. “It removes the protection for Americans,” says a Pentagon official who is concerned about the law. “It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.”
> 
>According to this official, “senior public affairs” officers within the Department of Defense want to “get rid” of Smith-Mundt and other restrictions because it prevents information activities designed to prop up unpopular policies—like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."  
>

This amendment was slipped into the 2013 NDAA and passed into law. Why does it seem like every NDAA that passes just takes more of our rights away? The previous year’s NDAA, 2012, we saw the provisions authorizing the indefinite military detention of civilians, including U.S. citizens, without habeas corpus or due process.

​Not that the legality of using propaganda against US citizens ever mattered. In 2008, investigative journalist David Barstow published an exposé in the New York Times revealing the details of a propaganda program used by the DoD since 2002. The Pentagon military analyst program was a campaign to influence public opinion of the Iraq war by briefing retired commanders for TV and radio appearances. Many published op-eds in the New York Times, as well as other newspapers and websites. They were always presented as independent analysts, rather than the mouthpiece of the military-industrial-complex that they really were.

</div>
  
​​From Barstow’s exposé, Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon’s Hidden Hand:  
  
>“Five years into the Iraq war, most details of the architecture and execution of the Pentagon’s campaign have never been disclosed. But The Times successfully sued the Defense Department to gain access to 8,000 pages of e-mail messages, transcripts and records describing years of private briefings, trips to Iraq and Guantánamo and an extensive Pentagon talking points operation.
> 
These records reveal a symbiotic relationship where the usual dividing lines between government and journalism have been obliterated.
> 
>“Internal Pentagon documents repeatedly refer to the military analysts as “message force multipliers” or “surrogates” who could be counted on to deliver administration “themes and messages” to millions of Americans “in the form of their own opinions.””<br>
>​* * * * *<br>
>​“Over time, the Pentagon recruited more than 75 retired officers, although some participated only briefly or sporadically. The largest contingent was affiliated with Fox News, followed by NBC and CNN, the other networks with 24-hour cable outlets. But analysts from CBS and ABC were included, too. Some recruits, though not on any network payroll, were influential in other ways — either because they were sought out by radio hosts, or because they often published op-ed articles or were quoted in magazines, Web sites and newspapers. At least nine of them have written op-ed articles for The Times.
> 
>The group was heavily represented by men involved in the business of helping companies win military contracts. Several held senior positions with contractors that gave them direct responsibility for winning new Pentagon business. James Marks, a retired Army general and analyst for CNN from 2004 to 2007, pursued military and intelligence contracts as a senior executive with McNeil Technologies. Still others held board positions with military firms that gave them responsibility for government business. General McInerney, the Fox analyst, for example, sits on the boards of several military contractors, including Nortel Government Solutions, a supplier of communication networks.”

​​On the Wikipedia page for the Pentagon military analyst program it states:  
  
>“On 28 April 2008, the Pentagon ended the operation. A DoD Inspector General investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the DoD.”  
>
>* <span class="ref">Pentagon Military Analyst Program (Wikipedia): <https://archive.fo/EzW2Q></span>  
  
It’s correct that the Inspector General found no wrongdoing on part of the DoD. You can read David Barstow’s follow up article on that here:  
  
* <span class="ref">Pentagon Finds No Fault in Ties to TV Analysts - David Barstow (NYTimes): <https://web.archive.org/web/20170409062720/http:/www.gao.gov/assets/390/386306.pdf></span>

Wikipedia however is not correct in saying the operation ended back in 2008.

​In 2009, Brad Jacobson and Ron Brynaert, of Raw Story, contacted DoD senior officials responsible for the program in an investigation into whether or not the operation had truly ended. Needless to say the DoD officials danced around the subject refusing to provide a yes or no answer.  
  
>“A week after David Barstow’s New York Times expose on the program broke in April 2008, Whitman said the military analyst program’s suspension was only “temporary.”
> 
>Reiterating at the time that he thought the program was merely a way to better inform the American public, he also said, “It’s temporarily suspended just so that we can take a look at some of the concerns.”
> 
>When Raw Story asked Mr. Whitman if this program was still being run out of the Pentagon, he first replied firmly, “No, not at this point.””

> 
>It turns out this was far from a casual reference. Raw Story has discovered new evidence that directly exposes this stealth media project and the activities of its participants as matching the US government’s own definition of psychological operations, or PSYOPS.

>The US Army Civil Affairs & Psychological Operations Command fact sheet, which states that PSYOPS should be directed “to foreign audiences” only, includes the following description:
> 
>“Used during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments.”
> 
>Pentagon public affairs officials referred to the military analysts as “message force multipliers” in documented communications.”

# <a name="global-engagement-center"></a>The Global Engagement (Propaganda) Center  

<a href="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/editor/propmsm1.png?1491960947" class="lightbox_trigger"><img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/editor/propmsm1.png?1491960947" alt="image: Propaganda. Control the media - The media controls us"></a>
  
The new propaganda bill introduced in March follows on the heels of H.R. 5181: Countering Foreign Propaganda & Disinformation Act of 2016, also known as S. 2692, Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016. This bill was very quietly inserted into the NDAA 2017 and signed into law by Obama in December 2016.
 
H.R. 5181 calls for the creation of a “Center”, “to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining United States national security interests.”  
  
>“Developing and disseminating fact-based narratives and analysis to counter propaganda and disinformation directed at United States allies and partners.”
> 
>“$20,000,000 to support the Center and provide grants or contracts of financial support to civil society groups, journalists, nongovernmental organizations, federally funded research and development centers, private companies, or academic institutions for the following purposes:
>​
>(A) To support local independent media who are best placed to refute foreign disinformation and manipulation in their own communities.”
>
>* <span class="ref">H.R. 5181: Countering Foreign Propaganda & Disinformation Act of 2016: <https://web.archive.org/web/20170412170414/http://www.publicdiplomacycouncil.org/sites/default/files/Portman-Murphy%20Counter%20Foreign%20Propaganda%20and%20Disinformation%20Act.pdf></span>  
  
The NDAA version of this bill is basically the same, except in the NDAA the "Center" is referred to as the Global Engagement Center.
​​
So taxpayers' money is being spent on the creation of a [Ministry of Truth](https://archive.fo/it0ri#selection-1253.0-1253.17) and bribing journalists and NGO’s to lie to us.
 
In about 50 years we’ll probably see declassified documents on the use of propaganda on the US population and the collusion between CIA and mainstream media in 2016.
 
In the meantime, here are newly declassified documents from 1965:  
  
* <span class="ref">Memo offers a look into the CIA’s private press pool (Muckrock): <https://archive.fo/8xlak></span>  
* <span class="ref">Newly-Declassified Documents Show that CIA Worked Closely with Owners and Journalists with Many of the Largest Media Outlets (Zero Hedge): <https://archive.fo/JUapc></span>  
  
Here’s another bill that hasn’t been passed yet:  
  
[HR 6393: Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017](https://archive.fo/pw36j). Slipped into this act was “Title V, Section 501: Committee to counter active measures by the Russian Federation to exert covert influence over peoples and governments”. Included in the list of “covert influence” are “media manipulation” and “disinformation”.
 
Here we see the “fake news” narrative in action. In desperation the kleptocrats are trying to shut down the rising anti-establishment views, which are becoming more widespread as people awaken to the truth. The entire system on both sides of the nonexistent two-party wall is corrupt.

​Not only has there been very little evidence provided that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack; was there even a hack? It probably doesn’t matter either way since the neocons and neoliberals are so nostalgic for the Cold War days. Let’s call this the Third Red Scare.
 
The push to blame Russia and “fake news” seemed to begin after Wikileaks released the Podesta emails. Instead of focusing on the corruption, lies and media collusion, the establishment and mainstream media tried to divert everyone’s attention.

I’ve thought about it and honestly, I don’t give a damn if Russia hacked the DNC. The DNC are corrupt, and so are the RNC. Influence the elections? You know who influences US elections? The oligarchs, the corporations, the foreign interests that bribe our so called “representatives”. Our political system is a joke.
 
If releasing truthful information about our corrupt politicians influenced the election, then I’m all for it! Would you really rather be kept in the dark about what’s truly happening in our government? Would you rather believe the lies and promises that you’re told by politicians when the cameras are on? Sadly there are those that would, only because they are told that’s what they want. Now those are the people truly loyal to the party. I think there was a book about that called 1984. Let’s just stop pretending already that there’s actually a two-party system, throw out the Democrat and Republican labels and just called the party Ingsoc. Who knows, maybe after this Third Red Scare they will. Who do you think will be the new “radical threats to American society”?  
 
​Anarchists. They always have to be number one. For over a hundred years there has been a system in place to shape people’s view of Anarchists. The majority of people, when you say Anarchist, think of senseless violence and people that eat babies. Well maybe not eating babies, but you get the point. The whole “no rulers” thing is about as dangerous as you can get for a kleptocrat. If you don’t know much about Anarchism, or its history, look it up – look up Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. I’ll bet it’s not what you think it is.)  
  
  
# <a name="first-red-scare"></a>The First Red Scare  

<a href="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/we-are-ungovernable_orig.png" class="lightbox_trigger"><img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/we-are-ungovernable_orig.png" alt="image: we are ungovernable"></a>
  
Did you know the first red scare was created to stifle labor worker strikes in the early 1900’s? It was the anarchists and labor unions that got us the 8 hour work day, instead of the 12-18 hour days they were forced to work. 
 
Those “evil” anarchists wanted rights for the poor, wanted the wealthy and the corporations to stop stealing from the people that actually worked hard for this country.  
  
>From: [The Brief Origins of May Day](https://archive.fo/yeq5n) – Eric Chase (IWW)
>
>“A variety of socialist organizations sprung up throughout the later half of the 19th century, ranging from political parties to choir groups. In fact, many socialists were elected into governmental office by their constituency. But again, many of these socialists were ham-strung by the political process which was so evidently controlled by big business and the bi-partisan political machine. Tens of thousands of socialists broke ranks from their parties, rebuffed the entire political process, which was seen as nothing more than protection for the wealthy, and created anarchist groups throughout the country. Literally thousands of working people embraced the ideals of anarchism, which sought to put an end to all hierarchical structures (including government), emphasized worker controlled industry, and valued direct action over the bureaucratic political process. It is inaccurate to say that labor unions were "taken over" by anarchists and socialists, but rather anarchists and socialist made up the labor unions.”
>
>“At its national convention in Chicago, held in 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (which later became the American Federation of Labor), proclaimed that "eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labor from and after May 1, 1886." The following year, the FOTLU, backed by many Knights of Labor locals, reiterated their proclamation stating that it would be supported by strikes and demonstrations. At first, most radicals and anarchists regarded this demand as too reformist, failing to strike "at the root of the evil." A year before the Haymarket Massacre, Samuel Fielden pointed out in the anarchist newspaper, The Alarm, that "whether a man works eight hours a day or ten hours a day, he is still a slave."”
> 
>“Not surprisingly the entire city was prepared for mass bloodshed, reminiscent of the railroad strike a decade earlier when police and soldiers gunned down hundreds of striking workers. On May 1, 1886, more than 300,000 workers in 13,000 businesses across the United States walked off their jobs in the first May Day celebration in history. In Chicago, the epicenter for the 8-hour day agitators, 40,000 went out on strike with the anarchists in the forefront of the public's eye. With their fiery speeches and revolutionary ideology of direct action, anarchists and anarchism became respected and embraced by the working people and despised by the capitalists.”  
  
**Anarchy literally means “no rulers”. That’s why our “rulers” hate them so much.  
People in power will do anything to stay in power.**
  
Here’s a very basic overview of the Red Scare from [Wikipedia](https://archive.fo/7BOaH):  
  
>A "Red Scare" is the promotion of fear of a potential rise of communism or radical leftism. In the United States, the First Red Scare was about worker (socialist) revolution and political radicalism. The Second Red Scare was focused on national and foreign communists infiltrating or subverting U.S. society, the federal government, or both.”
> 
>“The first Red Scare began following the Bolshevik Russian Revolution of 1917 and the intensely patriotic years of World War I as anarchist and left-wing social agitation aggravated national, social, and political tensions.”
> 
>“Newspapers exacerbated those political fears into anti-foreign sentiment because varieties of radical anarchism were becoming popular as possible solutions to poverty, often by recent European immigrants (cf. hyphenated-Americans). When the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) backed several labor strikes in 1916 and 1917, the press portrayed them as "radical threats to American society" inspired by "left-wing, foreign agents provocateurs." Those on the side of the IWW claim that the press "misrepresented legitimate labor strikes" as "crimes against society," "conspiracies against the government," and "plots to establish communism." Opponents, on the other hand, saw these as an extension of the radical, anarchist foundations of the IWW, which contends that all workers should be united as a social class and that capitalism and the wage system should be abolished.”  
  
​OH NO! A solution to poverty? Abolish the slave wage system? We must fight against such threats to the kleptocratic order of the US Empire!   
  
​₍₍ ᕕ(´◓⌓◔)ᕗ⁾⁾  <-- That’s me, running to fight for my masters, the kleptocrats. LOL.
 
Take a look at that again:  
  
>“The press portrayed (labor strikes) as 'radical threats to American society' inspired by 'left-wing, foreign agents provocateurs.'”  
  
Sound familiar? Why would they bother changing the playbook when it works every time? It’s working now isn’t it? Russia hacked the DNC, influenced US elections, made Hillary Clinton look bad! Sigh…
 
It is currently the “left” screaming Red, but don’t think the “right” is innocent either. It’s the Republicans that are introducing all the censorship bills to fight Russia’s “propaganda agents”. These bills will only be used to stifle free speech and take away our First Amendment rights permanently. Just read the Washington Post’s article on PropOrNot and their list of “Russian propaganda” websites. It’s only a list of media sites that don’t lick the boots of the kleptocrats. Do you think I’m over-exaggerating?  
  
Here are [ProporNot’s signs of Russian propaganda](https://archive.fo/6OUZR):  

<a href="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/proplist_orig.png" class="lightbox_trigger"><img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/proplist_orig.png" alt="image: PropOrNot's Signs of Propaganda"></a>
  
So that’s basically criticism of:

*    Obama
*    Hillary Clinton
*    the EU
*    Angela Merkel
*    NATO
*    Ukraine
*    Jewish People (Must be a typo, I think they meant Israel)
*    US allies
*    Mainstream media
*    Democrats and other Lefties (the warmongering ones anyway)

I think they left out “WAR”.  
  
It’s very telling isn’t it? Any guesses as to who funds this group?
 
Here’s their original blacklist of websites:
<https://archive.fo/RPSrB>
 
Personally, I’m not a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars, but I don’t think it’s likely they are Russian agents, and I don’t think they should be charged with treason under the Espionage Act like ProporNot proposes.
