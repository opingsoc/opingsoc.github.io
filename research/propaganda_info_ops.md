# <a name="propornot-wapo-cia"></a>PART ONE: PropOrNot, The Washington Post & the CIA  

<img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/editor/telly_1.png" alt="image: turn off the tv">  

PropOrNot warns people about Russian propaganda online. “Russia is manipulating US public opinion through online propaganda”. This would be a great service if it was real. Who wouldn’t want to know if they were being manipulated? Unfortunately their definition of online propaganda is basically: alternative media sites or blogs that contain any criticism of US foreign policy, Hillary Clinton, Ukrainian Ultra-Nationalists and US involvement in the war in Syria. They themselves are propagandists.  
  
Their blacklist of “Russian propaganda sites” includes Truthdig, Wikileaks, True Activist, Max Keiser, Ron Paul Institute, Zero Hedge and many more. They want these sites to be investigated by the federal government and prosecuted under the Espionage Act as Russian spies. If you promise to stop posting the content they don’t want you to post, you can talk to them about possibly being removed from the list.

The people behind PropOrNot have decided to remain anonymous. There’s no Whois information on the website’s registrant because they hide behind a service called Domain By Proxy.

<div class="caption">

</div>

No one knows who is really behind the site, but we do have some clues as to what groups and people are involved in this wave of “fake news” and Cold War hysteria.

Not knowing who is behind the website, the Washington Post still published an article claiming PropOrNot was comprised of “experts” and called out alternative media for Russian propaganda. Because of heavy criticism the Post was forced to add a disclaimer to their article. "The Post, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot’s findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so." Too little, too late, and that’s why they continue to print maliciously false claims. Even if they retracted the article  the damage has been done. The narrative has become the weapon for the government and mainstream media to use against our constitutional rights.

* <span class="ref">Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election, experts say (Washington Post): <https://archive.fo/DnEgL></span>

​It should also be mentioned that the Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. Here are a few interesting facts about Bezos:

* Amazon has a $600 million cloud contract with the CIA.
* Bezos was one of the very early investors in Google.
* His grandfather was regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and supervised Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Laboratories.

Both the Washington Post and the New York Times have had a close working relationship with the CIA since the 1950's. Other news agencies also worked with the CIA and the White House, printing anything they were told. The Washington Post and New York Times are long standing favorites of the CIA -- tools to push their narrative, and willing partners in the decades long CIA PSYOP against the American people.

>"CIA secret ties with the Post and other Fawning Corporate Media (FCM) go back several decades. After leaving the Post in 1977, Carl Bernstein wrote a major story for Rolling Stone (Oct. 20, 1977) showing how the FCM worked hand in glove with the CIA and how this was all covered up by the committee led by (Senator) Frank Church in 1975."

<h2><a name="cold-war-committee"></a>Cold War Committee Created with the Passing Of H.R. 6393</h2>

Coincidently, a propaganda bill was introduced to the House two days before the Washington Post article was published, and then passed 8 days later, slipped inside the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (H.R. 6393) on November 30th, 2016.

Title V — Matters relating to foreign countries, Section 501, calls for a "committee to counter active measures by Russia to exert covert influence over people and governments." ​“Active measures by Russia,” include "media manipulation", "disinformation" and "incitement".

So, if we continue to follow this narrative, we have alternative media sites spreading “Russian propaganda” and disinformation that manipulated the US presidential election. They have also supposedly incited violence and hatred for US foreign policy. (Otherwise we Americans would have no reason to criticize these fair, just and noble policies). Oh, and the scoundrels should be charged with espionage! Arrrr ye scurvy dogs! President Obama then signs into law an intelligence authorization, to create a committee that will counter these active measures by Russia. We should also mention that "assassinations" and "terrorist acts" are shown on the same list as "disinformation" and "media manipulation". It's possible PropOrNot may just get their wish for alternative media to be investigated for espionage.

* <span class="ref">House Quietly Passes Bill Targeting "Russian Propaganda" Websites: <https://archive.fo/8fPMD></span>
* <span class="ref">Text of H.R. 6393, Title V, Section 501: <https://tinyurl.com/HR6393></span>

Doesn’t this sound like a call to remove any criticism and opposition to US foreign policy, and US policy in general? Anything that doesn’t agree with the government’s narrative can be considered Russian propaganda. We’ve already witnessed this by the fake news hysteria that’s being spread by the establishment. We are witnessing the US pivot to fascism and dictatorship, just like all the countries the US government has overthrown.

You’ve probably heard the poem by Pastor Martin Niemöller, about the cowardice of German intellectuals following the Nazi’s rise to power: ​


>“First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out--
Because I was not a Socialist.
>
>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out--
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
>
>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out--
Because I was not a Jew.
>
>Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.”

It’s time to speak, because we are coming close to that last line of the poem. ​​​

Have the chickens come home to roost?

This is a time when it is extremely important to think before we act. When joining a protest we should question what is actually being protested, and what are the demands, the goals? Are there any?

Protest and mass disruption, especially that which is violent or destructive can easily be manipulated, co-opted and spun to advance the establishment's agenda. This is usually the antithesis of what is good for we the people.

We've already started to see the signs of a CIA and Soros sponsored coup or "color revolution" in the US. There is a massive disinformation campaign going on and we may be entering the 2nd stage, "Violent Street Demonstrations". That's why it's always imperative to question.

>"Most U.S. coups follow a model that has hardly changed between 1953 and the latest coup in Ukraine in 2014.  This model has three stages":
>
>1) Creating and strengthening opposition forces
"In the early stages of a U.S. plan for regime change, there is little difference between the methods used to achieve it at the ballot box or by an anti-constitutional coup.  Many of these tools and methods were developed to install right-wing governments in occupied countries in Europe and Asia after World War II.  They include forming and funding conservative political parties, student groups, trade unions and media outlets, and running well-oiled propaganda campaigns both in the country being targeted and in regional, international and U.S. media."
>
>2) Violent street demonstrations
"In the West, we tend to interpret street demonstrations as representing surges of populism and democracy.  But we should distinguish left-wing demonstrations against right-wing governments from the kind of violent right-wing demonstrations that have always been part of U.S. regime change strategy."
>
>3) The coup d'etat
"The creation and grooming of opposition forces and the spread of violence in the streets are deliberate strategies to create a state of emergency as a pretext for removing an elected or constitutional government and seizing power."
>
>* <span class="ref">America's Coup Machine: Destroying Democracy Since 1953: <https://archive.fo/XMRIc></span>


### <a name="color-revolution"></a>What is a color revolution?

>"Participants in the color revolutions have mostly used nonviolent resistance, also called civil resistance. Such methods as demonstrations, strikes and interventions have been [used to] protest against governments seen as corrupt and/or authoritarian, and to advocate democracy; and they have also created strong pressure for change. These movements all adopted a specific color or flower as their symbol. The color revolutions are notable for the important role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and particularly student activists in organizing creative non-violent resistance."
>
>* <span class="ref">Color Revolution (Wikipedia): <https://archive.fo/R9YAE></span>

>"What the Wikipedia article fails to mention is the massive foreign funding, and at least any notion that color revolutions are psychosocial operations of deception.
>
>It's a fact that Western governments (especially the US government) and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) [Soros] spend millions of dollars to co-opt and "channel" local populations of targeted countries against their own political leadership.
>
>Empty democracy slogans and flashy colors aside, we argue that color revolutions are good old-fashioned regime change operations: destabilization without the tanks.
>
>The secret ingredient is a sophisticated science used to manipulate emotions and circumvent critical thinking. History shows that, to much of the power elite, humanity is seen as a collection of nerve endings to be pushed and pulled one way or the other, sometimes made to tremble in fear, sometimes made to salivate like Pavlov's dogs. These days the manipulation is so pervasive, so subtle, so effective, that even critical individuals at times must necessarily fail to recognize how often--or in what context--they have fallen prey.
>
>Of course fear is the most obvious emotion played upon to effect massive social change. One need only to reflect upon the last ten years, since 9/11, to know that fear is a primary instrument used to initiate and justify dangerous shifts in public policy.
>
>But as humanity has been physiologically equipped with a range of emotions, and is not merely arrested and controlled by fear alone, a strata of behavioral and political science also found it useful to master the flip-side of the emotional spectrum, and by that we mean desire, and all that drives groups of individuals to act, even in the face of fear, in pursuit of something worthwhile.
>
>Looking beneath the facade of the color revolutionary movement we also find a desire-based behavioral structure, in particular one that has been built upon historical lessons offered by social movements and periods of political upheaval."
>
>"It then makes sense that the personnel of such operations include perception managers, PR firms, pollsters and opinion-makers in the social media. Through the operational infrastructure, these entities work in close coordination with intelligence agents, local and foreign activists, strategists and tacticians, tax-exempt foundations, governmental agencies, and a host of non- governmental organizations.
>
>**Collectively, their job is to make a palace coup (of their sponsorship) seem like a social revolution; to help fill the streets with fearless demonstrators advocating on behalf of a government of their choosing, which then legitimizes the sham governments with the authenticity of popular democracy and revolutionary fervor.**
>
>Because the operatives perform much of their craft in the open, their effectiveness is heavily predicated upon their ability to veil the influence backing them, and the long-term intentions guiding their work.
>
>Their effectiveness is predicated on their ability to deceive, targeting both local populations and foreign audiences with highly-misleading interpretations of the underlying causes provoking these events."

## <a name="disinfo-act-s3274"></a>Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act (S.3274)  

<img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/published/nothing-to-hide-cut.jpeg?1490225445" alt="image:nothing to fear">

A month after the previously mentioned propaganda bill was passed (H.R. 6393), the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act (S.3274) was passed and placed into the NDAA for 2017 (S.2943). Signed by Obama on December 23rd, 2016.

This bill calls for the creation of a “Center”, now named the Global Engagement Center, “to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining United States national security interests.”

>“The legislation establishes a fund to help train local journalists and provide grants and contracts to NGOs, civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government with experience in identifying and analyzing the latest trends in foreign government disinformation techniques.”
>
>* <span class="ref">Senate Passes Major Portman-Murphy Counter-Propaganda Bill as Part of NDAA: <https://archive.fo/BEA8j></span>

Oh, great, will PropOrNot be one of them? So in essence, this bill is a bunch of money being thrown at a new propaganda agency. We should call it the Ministry of Truth. That’s got a catchy ring to it. Senators that sponsored the bill claim it will only be used against foreign agents in foreign countries. But the bill says: “foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation.”

The article below by Naked Capitalism* does a great job in going over the ambiguities in the bill. For example, "foreign state and non-state propaganda"; do they mean "foreign non-state actors" or just "non-state actors"? He found a line from a previous NDAA that says something similar: "including threats from foreign countries and foreign non-state actors." In this statement there's no ambiguity, it's very clear they are only referring to foreign actors. The bill that was just passed could be construed to mean both foreign and domestic "non-state propaganda".

## <a name="smith-mundi"></a>Smith-Mundi Act Amendment - Lifting the Ban on Domestic Propaganda

<img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/bernays_orig.png" alt="image:Bernays Quote">

It really does go on and on and on.... so here's the general info: By amending the Smith-Mundi Act in the NDAA for 2013, essentially a ban on domestic propaganda was lifted. In the US we are now able to hear the same propaganda the US government airs in foreign countries.

**​Overview from Wikipedia:**

>"Under § 501 of the Smith–Mundt Act of 1948, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens, until July 2013 when it was repealed in the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013. The intent of the legislation in 1948 was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by its own government."
>
>* <span class="ref">Voice of America: <https://archive.fo/Ra3GX></span>

>"The U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (Public Law 80-402), popularly called the Smith–Mundt Act, specifies the terms in which the United States government can engage global audiences, also known as propaganda. [...] signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on January 27, 1948."
>
>"The shift from wartime to peacetime "propaganda" operations was not taken lightly by Congress, especially with fresh memories of President Woodrow Wilson’s Committee on Public Information (CPI), President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Office of War Information (OWI), and the Nazi propaganda machine, but there were other, deeper concerns on which Congress focused."
>
>* <span class="ref">Smith–Mundt Act: <https://archive.fo/g2xAU></span>

Wait... what was the purpose of the original legislation?

>" ...to protect the American public from propaganda actions by its own government. "

​I think we can safely say at this point that Congress no longer gives a damn about the American people.


### The real reasons why
 The following article was written in 2012  prior to the passing of this amendment. We want to give a shout out to an amazing journalist that is greatly missed, Michael Hastings. We won't forget.

>"[...] the law would allow “U.S. propaganda intended to influence foreign audiences to be used on the domestic population.”
>
>​"The new law would give sweeping powers to the government to push television, radio, newspaper, and social media onto the U.S. public. “It removes the protection for Americans,” says a Pentagon official who is concerned about the law. “It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.
>
>According to this official, “senior public affairs” officers within the Department of Defense want to “get rid” of Smith-Mundt and other restrictions because it prevents information activities designed to prop up unpopular policies—like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."
>
>* <span class="ref">Congressmen Seek To Lift Propaganda Ban (Michael Hastings, 2012):  <https://archive.fo/rYEgP></span>


### The asinine excuses

>"It’s being branded by proponents as an attempt at transparency, but critics of a new law say the United States government just got the green-light to use propaganda made for foreign audiences on the American public."
>
>* <span class="ref">US ends ban on 'domestic propaganda': <https://archive.fo/uzofR></span>

​Transparency?! What backwards, completely-detached-from-reality PSYOP school did these people go to? 'We're going to deceive to our own people in the name of transparency'. Seriously?


### The legal jargon
"public diplomacy information" = **propaganda**

“information and material intended primarily for foreign audiences” = **propaganda**

With the propaganda bills and the calls for censorship, we have a very, very serious threat against our First Amendment rights. These actions can knock out 3 of the 5 pillars of the First Amendment.

Hell, we might as well knock out the 4th one and make sure the last one is completely dead. We don’t want people complaining or criticizing the government. In the spirit of killing our First Amendment rights, Sen.

>“The outrageous bill, which has now been formally introduced for consideration during the 2017 legislative session, would make any form of protest that causes an "economic disruption" a class C felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. It wouldn't just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism, it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes a protest that authorities deem as "disruptive."

Let's circle back to PropOrNot, our "friendly neighborhood" propaganda agency. The first person that seems to have mentioned and promoted PropOrNot in print was Yale history professor Tim Snyder. This was before PropOrNot got exposure from the Washington Post. Snyder is an American historian, author, and academic specializing in the history of Central and Eastern Europe  and the Holocaust. He’s also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Note his specialization in the history of Central and Eastern Europe, it will be important later. He's the State Department's favorite go-to Eastern European historian and academic, especially when it comes to Ukraine.

One could call him the intellectual darling of the State Department's Eastern European desk. He became more publicly active during the 2014 Ukraine crisis which he used to push his warmed over cold-war “Stalin was as bad as Hitler” line of liberalism. No sane person would argue for the humanitarian nature of Stalinism, but Snyder's reading and writing history omits many actors from the Eastern European stage of history that resisted both authoritarian nationalism and authoritarian communism from a perspective that was not centrist, authoritarian and beholden to business elites."

​His rhetoric is pretty sneaky and subtle. At first glance he seems like someone who truly does care about freedom and the constitution, but upon closer examination he's just another puppet. He wrote a post called “20 Lessons from the 20th Century on How to Survive in Trump’s America.”  Originally it was a private Facebook post, then it was posted by several online media sites. 


>"#9: Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Bookmark PropOrNot and other sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes." 

Does he not realize the "Russian propaganda" listed on PropOrNot's website is alternative media, and some of the only investigative journalism that is fighting for freedom and truth? I think he does.

>#1: "Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You've already done this, haven't you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.”

Okay, so sounds good on the surface right? But why is he using the word "unfreedom"? Isn't that one of the examples of Newspeak in Orwell's 1984? Should we ask him if he thinks unfreedom is doubleplusgood or doubleplusungood?
 
The Mockingbird Paper has a great breakdown of Snyder's 20 lessons. It's worth reading to get an idea of how sneaky the Establishment can be. Pay close attention to the words and images being used in mainstream media, they're trying to change the way we think and even our understanding of words and ideas. Always question. 

>"Yale Professor Snyder does not know that “unfreedom” is not a word. Repression is the word he is looking for. More importantly “Do not Obey in advance”? Wrong. If you see a bad program coming, plan to disobey in advance. Build the secret rooms in your attic now to hide immigrants and dissidents later."

The next person possibly connected to PropOrNot is Joel Harding. There's a lot of information on Harding, but first we'll be giving an overview of what Information Operations (IO) are, and most importantly, Influence Operations. (We're  jumping into data mode now).

><span class="bold underline dark-gray">Influence Operations</span>  
>"Influence operations are focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of leaders, groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate commander’s intent, and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing behavior or a change in the adversary’s decision cycle, which aligns with the commander’s objectives. The military capabilities of influence operations are psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC), operations security (OPSEC), counterintelligence (CI) operations, counterpropaganda operations and public affairs (PA) operations."
>
><span class="bold underline dark-gray">Information Operations</span>  
>"Information Operations. The integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own. Also called IO."

>Focused US Government efforts to understand and engage key audiences in order to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of US Government interests, policies, and objectives through the use of coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national power."
>
>"In our usage, influence operations primarily consist of nonkinetic, communications-related, and informational activities that aim to affect cognitive, psychological, motivational, ideational, ideological, and moral characteristics of a target audience, and include:  
>* public affairs (PA)  
>* IO and most of its disciplines, but especially psychological operations (PSYOP)

Harding is the founder of Information Operations Holistic Organizers (IOHO)  

You can see from his own words that he's an Information Operations Specialist, who deals with the "dissemination of information and propaganda". He is "currently focusing on the Ukraine/Russia information war ".  

>"​Information operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical, operational and strategic information about an competitor as well as the dissemination of information and propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an competitor or adversary in the corporate, government or military realm.

Harding says he is the "primary author Ukraine National Strategy for Information Policy, submitted in 2015 and again in 2016".
 
In December 2014 the Ministry of Information Policy was established in Ukraine.   

>"Propornot is another incarnation of Stopfake or the Daily Dot. Both of these propaganda sites have been doing the same essential thing as propornot since the beginning of the 2014 Coup in Ukraine." 
> 
>"The people that wrote the Ukrainian information policy and developed the methods for the "Myrotvorets" or Peacemaker website did so with the sole goal of creating a clearinghouse for killing dissent and dissenters."
>​"The ministry oversees information policy in Ukraine. According to the first Minister of Information, Yuriy Stets, one of the goals of its formation was to counteract "Russian information aggression" amidst pro-Russian unrest across Ukraine, and the ongoing war in the Donbass region. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that the main function of the ministry is to stop 'the spreading of biased information about Ukraine'."
> 
>"Prior to its establishment, many Ukrainian journalists protested the creation of the ministry. They cited concerns that the ministry would 'open the way to grave excesses' in restricting free speech, and that the ministry would inhibit journalists' work. Journalists demonstrating outside the parliament building said that the creation of the ministry was equivalent to "a step back to the USSR". The ministry was given the satirical appellation "Ministry of Truth", a reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Reporters without Borders strongly opposed the creation of the ministry, and said that it was a 'retrograde step'."

The propaganda and counter-propaganda center to be created in the US following the passing of the "Countering Russian Propaganda and Disinformation Act" sounds a lot like the Ukraine's Ministry of Information Policy. 

As the "primary author of Ukraine's National Information Policy", Harding along with the Ministry of Information Policy would have been a part of the creation of the Ukrainian website "PeaceMaker" (Myrotvorets), which is similar to PropOrNot.  

<span class="ref">The base model for PropOrNot is the Ukrainian website "PeaceMaker" which gained fame in March 2015.</span>

Harding says he's spoken to the people behind PropOrNot: "I trust them and I do not say that easily or often. PropOrNot is legitimate, they have my seal of approval." PropOrNot used Harding's byline on the first page of their report condemning Counterpunch as Russian propaganda. Since then, Counterpunch was able to convince PropOrNot they weren't Russian propagandists and were removed from the site.

Here are excerpts from a blog by Joel Harding sharing his experience meeting with members of Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) in the U.S.:  

>"Last evening I had dinner with four Members of Parliament (MP) from Ukraine. It is actually called the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.
> 
>Taras Pastukh, Victoria Ptashnyk, Aliona Shkrum, and Anna Romanova were accompanied by a long-time friend of mine, Christina. [Krystyna V. Dobrovolska, a U.S. Embassy-assigned government liaison and translator who escorted the delegates from Kyiv during their visits to Albany and Washington].
> 
>I need to give a brief bit of history before proceeding, about the Ministry of Information Policy (Ukrainian: Міністерство інформаційної політики; abbreviated MIP).  The MIP was founded on 2 December 2014. Shortly after I was contacted and I produced a “National Information Strategy for Ukraine” on their behalf. After various corrections, I submitted the last version on 2 January 2014.  It was apparent, however, that their interest was in cyber only, which is only one of many aspects of ‘information operations’.
> 
>We discussed EU efforts to counter Russian propaganda, installing an office in Kyiv (which produces the Disinformation Review). We also discussed the NATO’s StratCom COE in Riga Latvia.
> 
>We also discussed various voluntary and NGO funded efforts, such as Inform Napalm, Stop Fake.org, and how these efforts are very effective but, collectively, fall short of what is necessary.

Harding has worked for the current Ukrainian government, which is officially recognized by the US and was placed into power by the CIA/MI6/Mossad. (More on that later).

Here's where it gets a bit complicated. Understanding the history of certain political groups in Ukraine is important to untangle the web of propaganda being spun by factions of the US gov't, mainstream media and US allied intelligence agencies. This all relates to what has been happening in Ukraine (which some call the Euromaiden Revolution and others call the Ukrainian Coup of 2014), why the U.S. is returning to McCarthyism, repressing our rights and seems to be recklessly pushing for a war with Russia. Later we will be releasing more information on the history of the OSS/CIA and Ukrainian Nationalist parties going back to WWII.
 
Ok, back to Joel Harding... Take a look at the slogan at the end of his blog entry: 
"Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava! Слава Україні! Героям слава! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!"  

>"Glory to Ukraine (Ukrainian: Слава Україні! Героям слава!, Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava!; translated as: Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!) is a Ukrainian greeting and slogan. "Glory to Ukraine" first appeared as a motto during the Ukrainian War of Independence (1917 - 1921), with the second part of greeting being commonly used by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.
> 
>The phrase has undergone a resurgence in recent times, becoming a popular and prominent refrain during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution."

This is one of the very early tweets from PropOrNot:

Another interesting thing of note is the website the above article is from: rferl.org. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). It's a US government funded broadcasting organization similar to Voice of America (VOA). RFE/RL and VOA are both supervised by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). The CIA funded RFE/RL until 1972. So we have PropOrNot accusing alternative media of being Russian propaganda, while they're posting articles from an arm of the US propaganda apparatus. It's sounding more and more like the US intelligence community is involved, along with their OUN-B fascist Ukrainian friends.  

On a side note, Joel Harding happens to be friends with one of the Board Members of the BBG, Matt Armstrong. (As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was an ex-officio member of the BBG from 2009-2013).  

>"I consider Matt to be the preeminent expert on the Smith Mundt Act, I have a sneaking suspicion he was involved in crafting H.R.5736 — the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012."

What a coincidence, that's the provision lifting the ban on the propaganda bill.  

There is a very interesting history between the OSS/CIA, OUN-B and Nazi's. Unfortunately we're only taught the whitewashed version of history.  We will have a second release containing unclassified CIA documents, among other resources that will help explain the relationship between the CIA and Ukraine.

<img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/0032_orig.png" alt="image: azov battalion">

Initially a volunteer unit, the Azov Battalion was incorporated into the Ukrainian National Guard in November 2014. In early reports members were open about the fact that they were neo-Nazi's and white supremacists. Although they use Nazi symbols like the swastika, SS Armanen runes, and the Wolfsangel, the soldiers in the Azov Battalion now claim they aren't Nazi's, but "National Socialists".  It sounds like at some point they received disinformation training from the US.

## <a name="hillary-clinton-chalupa-ukraine"></a>Hillary Clinton, Alexandra Chalupa & Ukraine  

Alright, so what does this have to do with PropOrNot and the recent surge in propaganda? 
 
The current goverment of Ukraine which the CIA, MI6 and Mossad helped put into power are composed of OUN members and their descendants. The majority of which are OUN-B members, or followers of Bandera.
 
In fact the major Ukrainian organizations in the US are also OUN-B, including the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). The Ukrainian-American organizations and the Ukrainian government backed Hillary Clinton this election. They also tried to sabotage Trump's campaign by pushing the Russian spy narrative - perhaps even starting the rumor. Why? One reason is Hillary's promise for more financial and military aid to Ukraine.  

* <span class="ref">Clinton urges more financial, military aid to Ukraine: <https://archive.fo/B6Jql></span>  

>"Politico reported that the Ukrainian Government worked to aid Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential elections. The actions taken by government officials included disseminating “documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.”
> 
>"Those documents implicated Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who worked as an adviser for now-ousted Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovych. However, the concerns that the documents raised weren’t in fact over any quasi-Russian ties, though partisan reporting pushed this narrative. Rather, the documents raised the question of whether Manafort declared the income that he had received from the position. The Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta, also conducted work for Yanukovych. However, the Manafort narrative not only painted Trump as pro-Russian, but also provided the Clinton campaign with a smear campaign while reaffirming its stance against Russia."
> 
>"Politico noted that Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American working as a consultant for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), met with top Ukrainian Officials in Washington D.C. about forcing Manafort’s resignation in order to perpetuate the narrative that Trump is connected to Russia. Both Chalupa and her sister Andrea have strongly pushed the anti-Russian narrative on social media, in addition to advocating that the electors of the electoral college defect from Trump. The report added, “Politico’s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another’s elections.”"
> 
>"In addition to the Chalupas, the co-founder and CTO of Crowdstrike, the cyber security firm that the DNC hired to investigate the alleged hacks, Dmitri Alperovitch, also serves as a senior fellow to the Washington-based think tank Atlantic Council, which is an openly anti-Russian organization. The Atlantic Council is funded by Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk, who also happens to be one of the most prolific donors to the Clinton Foundation. The DNC denied multiple requests from the FBI to access their servers, effectively forcing the FBI to rely on CrowdStrike’s assessment of the hacks."
> 
>"The Atlantic Council has propagated anti-Russian sentiment and advocated for bolstering NATO forces in anticipation of a military conflict between with Russia longbefore Wikileaks released emails from the DNC and Clinton Campaign Manager John Podesta. In 2013, the Atlantic Council awarded Hillary Clinton its Distinguished International Leadership Award. In 2014, the Atlantic Council hosted one of several events with former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who took over after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was removed in early 2014.""

>"​In October of this year, Yahoo News named Chalupa one of “16 People Who Shaped the 2016 Election” for her role in pinning the DNC leaks on Russian hackers, and for making the case that the Trump campaign was under Kremlin control. “As a Democratic Party consultant and proud Ukrainian-American, Alexandra Chalupa was outraged last spring when Donald Trump named Paul Manafort as his campaign manager,” the Yahoo profile began. “As she saw it, Manafort was a key figure in advancing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda inside her ancestral homeland — and she was determined to expose it.”
> 
>"In one leaked DNC email earlier this year, Chalupa boasts to DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda that she brought Isikoff to a US-government sponsored Washington event featuring 68 Ukrainian journalists, where Chalupa was invited “to speak specifically about Paul Manafort.” In turn, Isikoff named her as the key inside source “proving” that the Russians were behind the hacks, and that Trump’s campaign was under the spell of Kremlin spies and sorcerers."
> 
>"According to The Guardian, Chalupa recently sent a report to Congress proving Russian hacked into the vote count, hoping to initiate a Congressional investigation. In an interview with Gothamist, Chalupa described alleged Russian interference in the election result as “an act of war"."

>"The Atlantic Council itself is no stranger to the promotion of the Banderite [OUN-B] ideology as representing “democratic” Ukrainian nationalism. A Senior Fellow in its Translatlantic Relations Program is Adrian Karatnycky, formerly the head of Freedom House and an AFL-CIO political operations staffer. Karatnycky and his wife, National Endowment for Democracy (NED) Vice President Nadia Diuk, worked in the 1980s in programs run through Prolog Research Corporation, the front organization set up by the CIA in 1952 as a vehicle for Banderite war criminal Mykola Lebed to continue anti-Soviet operations. Diuk edited a Prolog-funded publication in London, while Karatnycky, according to published accounts by then-colleague Taras Kuzio (today a top expert on Ukraine for NATO), coordinated Prolog’s Ukrainian literature production through underground printing operations in Poland."

>"For 30 years, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has been sub-contracting the legal part of illegal CIA operations. Without rousing suspicions, it has put in place the biggest network of corruption in the world, bribing trade unions and management syndicates, political parties both on both the Right and Left so that they defend the interests of the United States instead of their members."

NED is also funding the Poynters Institute's International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which will be doing the fact-checking for Facebook. Other funders include the Open Society Foundations (George Soros), Google, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Omidyar Network. The Poynters Institute was founded by Nelson Poynter, who was a director in the US Coordinators Office of Information (COI), which later split into the OSS and Office of War Information (OWI).  

>"​Now more documents, in the massive 2,500 leaked tranche, show the immense power and control Soros had over Ukraine immediately following the illegal Maidan government overthrow. Soros and his NGO executives held detailed and extensive meetings with just about every actor involved in the Maidan coup…from US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, to Ukraine’s Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Health, and Education. Plans to subvert and undermine Russian influence and cultural ties to Ukraine are a central focus of every conversation. US hard power, and EU soft power, is central towards bringing Ukraine into the neo-liberal model that Soros champions, while bringing Russia to its economic knees."

Supposed themes of Russian propaganda masking as alternative media:

You'll notice that Hillary Clinton, George Soros & his Open Society Foundations, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CIA, mainstream media and all the US propaganda agencies, including the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Voice of America (VOA), and USAID, seem to have a similar agenda. For the last 60-70 years this agenda has also seemed to aligned with the that of the fascist Ukrainian Nationalists of the OUN-B.
 
Along with the International Fact-Checking Network, Soros also funds several fact-checking websites in the EU.
 
Considering the above information as well as the timing, it's probably safe to say the CIA is behind PropOrNot. The Ukrainian Nationalists, and all the other factions mentioned are mostly likely involved directly or indirectly as well.  
 
We can also get a good idea of who is behind PropOrNot by taking a look at their list of "Russian propaganda" themes:  
* Obama  
* Hillary Clinton  
* Angela Merkel  
* NATO  
* Ukraine  
* Jewish people (You think they meant to say Israel?)  
* U.S. Allies  
* Mainstream Media  

​​So, if you think any of the above are possibly corrupt and decide to voice your opinion, you're spreading Russian propaganda. PropOrNot claims their website is not a blacklist and it's not McCarthyism. LULZ.

It’s not just a push to silence activists and journalists but a full on information war against those of us who oppose government corruption and the warmongers running the US government. It’s a war against those of us who give a damn about free speech. This isn’t an exaggeration either. These same groups were willing to kill activists and journalists in Ukraine for the exact same reasons. Ukraine now has laws making it illegal to speak ill of the government, and anti-protesting laws have also been passed. They have also passed a law making it legal for the military to shoot deserters. These are the fascists that the US, UK and Israel backed in the 2014 coup/revolution in Ukraine. We helped put them in power. Now those same people are bringing the war to the US. Why? Probably because the US has the resources to go to war with Russia and Ukraine doesn't.
 
It's time to fight for our freedoms. The mainstream media is the Establishment's main propaganda tool in the US. These fake fact-checking sites funded by Soros and the CIA are enhancing the propaganda of mainstream media and trying to censor anything they don't agree with. It's time to show them that we aren't fooled. It's time to dismantle this propaganda machine. Together we are more powerful than we think, it's why the propaganda is so important to them...

**Because they fear us.**
