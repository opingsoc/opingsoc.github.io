The creators of Capitalism socially constructed a concept that put the primary objective of survival as profit. People who understood Capitalism would know that everything and anything can be turned into a business to make a profit, including human beings themselves. There are no boundaries in this ideology. As time went on profits were to be made on everything including: war, death, birth, and health. Almost every aspect of humanity is being exploited to make a profit.

The processes of Capitalism dehumanize people. Profits are more important than people and life is regarded cheaply. People die every day because of resource based wars, inferior quality of food, and poor environmental conditions. The modes of production for profit reign king among humanity. The CEOs, professionals, and venture capitalists who are paraded on media as gods; do not bat an eye when someone dies because of a medication they cannot afford. No one cares when a president starts an illegal war with no evidence and sends the lower classes to their deaths. The examples and the evidence is plenty. A system that turns everything into a business and exploits resources is not sustainable. A system that destroys the environment and does not build it, is not sustainable. For years people have been brainwashed through television and the media to believe that capitalism is the only way. But other ways are possible that advance both positively and equally.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us before he left the presidency, of the military industrial complex. The power and might that comes with this production of power is something that all should be concerned with. Capitalism, media, entertainment, and materialism have blinded people from the important situations that need to be attended to, and developed a need for the motivation to participate in being mindful of our reality. The tentacles of the military industrial complex have led to a consistent amount of conflicts on a global scale. War profiteering and the testing of new war technology is motivation for creating major conflicts.

It is plain to see the dominant hegemony position of the military industrial complex. The mainstream media pushes the war narrative in almost subliminal messaging - with fancy graphics, sounds, and colors. In the most recent U.S. government conflicts, mainstream media pushed specific dominant messages that created support for a position of war. What are these people trying to convince the population of? That war is peace and that it's what protects the population from terrorists? When a billion-dollar industry finds a niche in the war market and the only thing beneficial for them is war; where is the motivation for peace? No weapons would get built and no profits would be made. The powerful war profiteering lobbying groups keep the revolving doors open for war and the defense industry.

The military industrial complex has made the Defense industry a viable model for capital profiteering and investment. These companies receive millions in U.S. government contracts for military support and operations. The Defense companies make direct profit from war and violent conflicts around the world. For every war, their weapons are used, operations are conducted, revolving door contracts issued, and these companies make billions in revenue.

The never ending global war on terror is a perpetual loop for companies like DynCorp and Blackwater to continuously make millions in profit. When there is no conflict, violence, or war they stand to become broke. They have no interest in the investment of peace because there's no money to be made in that.

The U.S. government’s glutton for war has created a never-ending demand for mercenaries. Over the years, the lack of oversight and regulation has led to war crimes and atrocities against innocent civilians in the countries that they occupy. The U.S. government continuing to issue contracts, despite the investigations and evidence against these companies, doesn't do any justice to all those who have suffered at the hands of contractors like DynCorp.

Under the Bill Clinton administration, DynCorp International was hired to conduct operations in Bosnia. DynCorp has been a worldwide force providing maintenance support to the U.S. military through contract field tiers (CFTs). This means that they operate with the U.S. military on the ground. They're one of the U.S. government’s top twenty-five contractors. DynCorp was originally founded in 1946 as California Eastern Aviation Inc. by pilots returning from World War II, and the compnay has held government contracts ever since. DynCorp has expanded from aviation to other areas such as IT, computer software and even providing mercenaries. DynCorp offers their services worldwide and have run operations in Colombia, Haiti, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, UAE and more.

According to documents obtained from the Department of Defense, DynCorp International formed a human sex trafficking ring on multiple U.S. military bases. There were investigations conducted after complaints from military personnel and a DynCorp whistleblower came forward. This problem was largely ignored by the U.S. military and DynCorp employees and executives. Many involved in the misconduct were never brought to justice, nor any of it covered by the mainstream media. Many were too focused on the Monica Lewinsky scandal that had confidently been played up by media, blacking out the scandal that was unraveling in the U.S. military.

According to Donna Hugh’s and John Miller's investigation, DynCorp whistleblower Ben Johnston filed a complaint against DynCorp with the U.S. Army. He was witness to children being raped and sold by DynCorp employees. Johnston explained that these DynCorp employees were purchasing young girls ages 12 to 15 years old, as sex slaves. They worked with a local mafia organization in the region.

The military was aware of the problem with DynCorp but viewed it as a DynCorp problem. They chose not to intervene. As stated by Col. Braun, who was a base supervisor, the military was more concerned that their aircrafts were maintained and their needs met in the field. According to this investigation, DynCorp received $1 billion dollars in government contracts from 1995 to 2003. Even after the complaints against DynCorp the U.S. government continued to re-hire them for military operations overseas.

The employees of DynCorp that were involved in the child sex slave trafficking were merely fired from their positions. No one was prosecuted or punished for the atrocities that were committed. Contractors like DynCorp go unchecked and unregulated by the government. According to the Department of Defense, they don't have jurisdiction over the private contractors. Essentially the private contractors do not have to operate like the military does - they don't have to follow any ethical or moral guidelines. This is part of the reason why many people who committed these crimes were not brought to justice or prosecuted for what they did.

DynCorp is not the only private military company that has committed heinous crimes in other countries. There were several disturbing incidents involving companies like Blackwater, Titan, KBR, CACI International, and Triple Canopy committed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas of operation. Blackwater security guards murdered 17 civilians in Baghdad Nisour’s square. CACI International and Titan were involved with the Abu Ghuraib torture case. Another example of immoral and unethical behavior is when Jacob Washborne was involved in 3 unjustified shooting incidents. Before Jacob went on the operation he declared he wanted to kill somebody that day.

The United States private military contractors have been responsible for some of the worst crimes against humanity on a global scale. Despite all the evidence and all the documentation, the U.S. government still employs many of these contractors to this very day. There has been no real oversight or regulation of these private military corporations. The lack of immediate controls over these situations has demonstrated that the U.S. military and government have no interest in the safety of human beings not complicit with their mission or operation.  

  
# <a name="global-human-trafficking"></a>Global Human Trafficking  
  
Human trafficking and child sex rings are nothing new and have been noted in history by the Greek and the Roman government elites. There's evidence that a high profile member of the Roman government had young boys that he would bath with nude. He stated that he liked it when they bit him all over his naked body. There has been evidence of sexual abuse and rape of young children in that era of time. These types of acts are continued today in elite circles of the wealthy, many of whom are in positions of power and leadership.  
  
This is not just a domestic problem but a global one. There is a massive amount of information and research regarding the seriousness of the problem. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s the Catholic Church was exposed for child sexual abuse and rape committed by many of their priests since the 1950s. It was discovered by the Vatican and covered up until it was exposed years later. For many years, Catholic priests molested and raped possibly hundreds of thousands of children around the globe. Many of those priests were never prosecuted for their crimes. High profile members of the Vatican helped protect and cover up the crimes of their priests. These types of violations of humanity have been a widespread practice by elite circles of differing societal social contracts. Many other organizations have committed the same heinous crimes against innocent people and this unseemly trend has been perpetrated throughout time. As a society, we must be mindfully aware of things that have happened in the past to understand what is happening in the present.

Most recently, internet activists called Anonymous helped expose and bring attention to the operations and participation of government leaders, agencies, and military regarding child sex rings within the United Kingdom. According to government investigations, these child sex slave rings have been in operation since the early 1970s. Coincidentally, during those times and through the present there have been increased reports of missing children.

There have been many scandals and even some that come to the surface. In the late 1980s the Bush Administration was bringing young boys for late night “tours” of the White House. It even made newspaper headlines. A documentary called Conspiracy of Silence was supposed to be shown by the Discovery channel in the early 90s, but was threatened with restrictive legislation by the Bush Administration and told not to air the film. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased anonymously and they ordered all copies destroyed. A copy of the videotape was leaked anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp, who represented many of the abused children. He made the video available to retired F.B.I. chief, Ted L. Gunderson. The documentary interviewed the victims of sex slave trafficking. They gave detailed descriptions of people within the Republican Party such as Lawrence King who was a chairman of the party at the time. The boys that came for these late night tours were from the Nebraska based orphanage of Boys Town, which is a very well known orphanage in the United States.

The human trafficking problem is not just isolated to the military or private military contractors but also criminal organizations that operate domestically in the United States. They have been operating under the “radar” in the United States, even though recently Dr. Phil had a child sex slave victim on his show and there have been multiple reports of missing children in metro areas like Washington D.C. and Atlanta that get left unmentioned. Oddly enough no arrests came from the Dr. Phil show. There was no mainstream media coverage of the 10 black teenage girls that went missing in one week in the Washington D.C. area. It wasn't until recently that reports of sex slave rings have been getting cracked down on by the FBI. Largely these things get ignored by the mainstream media, and even people within the U.S. government have claimed that these issues are myths and rarely happen, when they happen much more frequently than most people know.

According to the Congressional Research Service the estimate for persons trafficked is 2 to 4 million people annually. This includes worldwide data. Many people in elevated levels of leadership both in the military and government have ignored the problem. Some of those people in elevated levels of leadership are involved with the crimes that are being committed.   


# <a name="distractions"></a>Distractions  

<a href="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/editor/dyncorp08.png?1499354991" class="lightbox_trigger"><img src="https://opingsoc.weebly.com/uploads/9/7/2/2/97221336/editor/dyncorp08.png?1499354991" alt="image of text: DynCorp parcel intercepted by Colomobian National Police, thick liquid tested positive for heroin"></a>
  
The Monica Lewinsky scandal was used to distract the mainstream media and the public from the atrocities private military contractors were committing against innocent people abroad. The Bill Clinton administration was very aware of what was happening in Bosnia and Kosovo.

There has been a pattern of certain events or leaks that happen. The Bush administration leaked classified CIA information to the press, which supposedly exposed a CIA agent. There were many illegal firings that Attorney General Antonio Gonzales was investigated for. Vice President Dick Cheney shot a man in the face and the man apologized to him for the inconvenient situation. Events like these are overly pushed by the mainstream media. Everyone covered these stories and brought more attention to them. Just about every single outlet was talking about how Dick Cheney shot a man in the face and the man apologized to him for it. Many controversial things happened during that administration, but people were distracted by the sensationalism of the headlines being played up by the mainstream media.

These distractions occur in every administration. They are used for political edge and gain. The current Trump Administration is a very good example of the use of distraction. Everything President Trump does is sensationalized in the mainstream media. Even during the presidential election Trump’s every word and every action was controversial. Most of his media attention came free because of how much the media sensationalized him. People must expose these distractions for what they are and carefully examine what is not being talked about.  


# <a name="understanding-our-role"></a>Understanding Our Role  
  
One should ask themselves, when the mainstream media is pushing a specific event or story through the cultural industries, what is really happening beneath the surface? What narrative is the mainstream media trying to create? What is the story they're trying to tell?

To understand the present, one must understand the past. People tend to repeat themselves and adhere to specific familiar patterns. It should be no surprise that those who are awarded power over others will exploit them for their own interests. Even if it causes pain to another person, they feel a sense of entitlement, that they can and should have whatever they want. This has translated over centuries of elite circles of the wealthy. It is important to become more mindfully aware of the past and of the present. The more people become aware of what is going on, the more people can do to make the world a better place. No one should be exploited for money. No one should become anyone's slave because someone else holds power over them. As people of this world, we should not accept that greed is glorified and rewarded. No one in this world should die or be murdered for profit or resources. No sick person should perish because they cannot afford the medication that could cure them. No person should die because another country wants their country’s resources. Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism all drive these motives against humanity.

People should not have to sacrifice their lives for corporations or government systems. A balance is needed within these systems of governance. No group of people should exploit another group unfairly. Regulation and oversight should be in place to help balance the system. These people who operate at the very high levels of capitalism do whatever they please. These people must be exposed and their actions stopped. Government contractors like DynCorp should not go unregulated and unpunished for the things they've done. Too many loop holes are exploited within this system. DynCorp aided in the operation of child sex rings around the world while making money from the U.S. government. This systemic effect was created by layers of previous events. Human trafficking must get more exposure by the media.

The more people report on things of this nature, the more humanity’s awareness will grow. Soon people will turn away from the mainstream media lies and find the real news. Only approved news is allowed on mainstream media. The time to stop the censorship of the internet is now. Things such as child sex trafficking being conducted by a U.S. government contractor, like DynCorp, will never be reported by media outlets like CNN or NBC. There is usually a mainstream media blackout of important conversations happening within the United States.

Each of us has a responsibility to think critically and expose the truth whenever we can. We cannot allow these terrible things to keep happening under the noses of the many. Events are disguised and people are distracted so no one will do anything about it. As decent human beings, we must all hold each other to a higher standard and do what we can to make a positive difference. Together as a collective we can co-create a reality of equality, dignity, and respect. These goals can be obtained if we stay strong and diligent regarding the exposure of truths in the pursuit of justice and equality.  

  
# <a name="post-script"></a>Post Script  
  
To those who feel discouraged, burnt out, or indifferent to the events and situations occurring in our shared, global, co-created reality: do not give up. Do not become callous in your communication with others. It is achievable, this notion of treating all living things with dignity and respect. It is achievable, that we can relinquish our corrupt leadership that controls and influences the global population. We are making a call to all human beings, energies, and living creatures. Create for yourself an open mind that can repel negative connotations and actions that seek to create an imbalance of power within this social system of control.

Take solace in the fact that there are other people out there who do care, who do want to make a difference no matter how hard the task. It is our human ability to tolerate so much pain, so much struggle and still be able to love. We want you to know that we have not given up and we will not give up. It takes all of us to make great change. Lay down your laziness. Lay down your ego. Lay down your selfishness. We all want a good life and we all want to be successful. Help break this system of distraction, materialism, and greed. It is reprehensible that human beings die undeserving and at the hands of those who hold more wealth than them. It is reprehensible that it's legal to make profit off of health, life, and death. There are those that will tell you, “This is the way it is. Things will never change.” “You can’t make a difference.” The system depends on people like this to reinforce the synthetic reality. The system wants us to think things will never change and we they can't do anything about the problems of today. There is a small group of people who want to maintain status quo. They want to maintain that a small group of people get an unequal and excessive amount of profit. These people of course don't want anything to change because they hold the majority of power, and they hold majority of control, even though they are the minority.

It is no mistake that travel or mobility is only allowed through socioeconomic status. The more currency you hold the farther you can travel down the river through the banks. “They” (1%) control the flow of human capital/assets. “They” determine your “official” level of education. “They” determine how far you can travel and where you can go. “They” control your quality of food. “They” control your wages. “They” control your physical, mental, and communication mobility. We set to change this social construct created by the global ultra wealthy.
